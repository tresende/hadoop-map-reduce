hamlet@1014	ACT I
hamlet@1020	
hamlet@1021	
hamlet@1022	
hamlet@1023	SCENE I	Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
hamlet@1071	
hamlet@1072	
hamlet@1073		[FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO]
hamlet@1121	
hamlet@1122	BERNARDO	Who's there?
hamlet@1144	
hamlet@1145	FRANCISCO	Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
hamlet@1199	
hamlet@1200	BERNARDO	Long live the king!
hamlet@1229	
hamlet@1230	FRANCISCO	Bernardo?
hamlet@1250	
hamlet@1251	BERNARDO	He.
hamlet@1264	
hamlet@1265	FRANCISCO	You come most carefully upon your hour.
hamlet@1315	
hamlet@1316	BERNARDO	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
hamlet@1377	
hamlet@1378	FRANCISCO	For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
hamlet@1435		And I am sick at heart.
hamlet@1460	
hamlet@1461	BERNARDO	Have you had quiet guard?
hamlet@1496	
hamlet@1497	FRANCISCO	Not a mouse stirring.
hamlet@1529	
hamlet@1530	BERNARDO	Well, good night.
hamlet@1557		If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
hamlet@1596		The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
hamlet@1642	
hamlet@1643	FRANCISCO	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
hamlet@1698	
hamlet@1699		[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
hamlet@1730	
hamlet@1731	HORATIO	Friends to this ground.
hamlet@1763	
hamlet@1764	MARCELLUS	And liegemen to the Dane.
hamlet@1800	
hamlet@1801	FRANCISCO	Give you good night.
hamlet@1832	
hamlet@1833	MARCELLUS	O, farewell, honest soldier:
hamlet@1872		Who hath relieved you?
hamlet@1896	
hamlet@1897	FRANCISCO	Bernardo has my place.
hamlet@1930		Give you good night.
hamlet@1952	
hamlet@1953		[Exit]
hamlet@1961	
hamlet@1962	MARCELLUS	Holla! Bernardo!
hamlet@1989	
hamlet@1990	BERNARDO	Say,
hamlet@2004		What, is Horatio there?
hamlet@2029	
hamlet@2030	HORATIO	A piece of him.
hamlet@2054	
hamlet@2055	BERNARDO	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
hamlet@2107	
hamlet@2108	MARCELLUS	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
hamlet@2164	
hamlet@2165	BERNARDO	I have seen nothing.
hamlet@2195	
hamlet@2196	MARCELLUS	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
hamlet@2241		And will not let belief take hold of him
hamlet@2283		Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
hamlet@2331		Therefore I have entreated him along
hamlet@2369		With us to watch the minutes of this night;
hamlet@2414		That if again this apparition come,
hamlet@2451		He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
hamlet@2493	
hamlet@2494	HORATIO	Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
hamlet@2533	
hamlet@2534	BERNARDO	Sit down awhile;
hamlet@2560		And let us once again assail your ears,
hamlet@2601		That are so fortified against our story
hamlet@2642		What we have two nights seen.
hamlet@2673	
hamlet@2674	HORATIO	Well, sit we down,
hamlet@2701		And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
hamlet@2742	
hamlet@2743	BERNARDO	Last night of all,
hamlet@2771		When yond same star that's westward from the pole
hamlet@2822		Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
hamlet@2873		Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
hamlet@2916		The bell then beating one,--
hamlet@2946	
hamlet@2947		[Enter Ghost]
hamlet@2962	
hamlet@2963	MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
hamlet@3024	
hamlet@3025	BERNARDO	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
hamlet@3081	
hamlet@3082	MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
hamlet@3134	
hamlet@3135	BERNARDO	Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
hamlet@3191	
hamlet@3192	HORATIO	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
hamlet@3247	
hamlet@3248	BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.
hamlet@3279	
hamlet@3280	MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.
hamlet@3312	
hamlet@3313	HORATIO	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
hamlet@3369		Together with that fair and warlike form
hamlet@3411		In which the majesty of buried Denmark
hamlet@3451		Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
hamlet@3505	
hamlet@3506	MARCELLUS	It is offended.
hamlet@3532	
hamlet@3533	BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!
hamlet@3581	
hamlet@3582	HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
hamlet@3632	
hamlet@3633		[Exit Ghost]
hamlet@3647	
hamlet@3648	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
hamlet@3690	
hamlet@3691	BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
hamlet@3745		Is not this something more than fantasy?
hamlet@3787		What think you on't?
hamlet@3809	
hamlet@3810	HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe
hamlet@3858		Without the sensible and true avouch
hamlet@3896		Of mine own eyes.
hamlet@3915	
hamlet@3916	MARCELLUS	                  Is it not like the king?
hamlet@3969	
hamlet@3970	HORATIO	As thou art to thyself:
hamlet@4002		Such was the very armour he had on
hamlet@4038		When he the ambitious Norway combated;
hamlet@4078		So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
hamlet@4124		He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
hamlet@4166		'Tis strange.
hamlet@4181	
hamlet@4182	MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
hamlet@4239		With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
hamlet@4286	
hamlet@4287	HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;
hamlet@4342		But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
hamlet@4385		This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
hamlet@4433	
hamlet@4434	MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
hamlet@4492		Why this same strict and most observant watch
hamlet@4539		So nightly toils the subject of the land,
hamlet@4582		And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
hamlet@4625		And foreign mart for implements of war;
hamlet@4666		Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
hamlet@4716		Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
hamlet@4759		What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
hamlet@4805		Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
hamlet@4855		Who is't that can inform me?
hamlet@4885	
hamlet@4886	HORATIO	That can I;
hamlet@4906		At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
hamlet@4953		Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
hamlet@4995		Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
hamlet@5039		Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
hamlet@5084		Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
hamlet@5136		For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
hamlet@5188		Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
hamlet@5240		Well ratified by law and heraldry,
hamlet@5276		Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
hamlet@5325		Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
hamlet@5370		Against the which, a moiety competent
hamlet@5409		Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
hamlet@5452		To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
hamlet@5487		Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
hamlet@5538		And carriage of the article design'd,
hamlet@5577		His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
hamlet@5626		Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
hamlet@5662		Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
hamlet@5707		Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
hamlet@5748		For food and diet, to some enterprise
hamlet@5787		That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
hamlet@5834		As it doth well appear unto our state--
hamlet@5875		But to recover of us, by strong hand
hamlet@5913		And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
hamlet@5959		So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
hamlet@6004		Is the main motive of our preparations,
hamlet@6045		The source of this our watch and the chief head
hamlet@6094		Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
hamlet@6138	
hamlet@6139	BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:
hamlet@6184		Well may it sort that this portentous figure
hamlet@6230		Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
hamlet@6279		That was and is the question of these wars.
hamlet@6324	
hamlet@6325	HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
hamlet@6373		In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
hamlet@6416		A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
hamlet@6457		The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
hamlet@6507		Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
hamlet@6552		As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
hamlet@6601		Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
hamlet@6643		Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
hamlet@6689		Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
hamlet@6732		And even the like precurse of fierce events,
hamlet@6778		As harbingers preceding still the fates
hamlet@6819		And prologue to the omen coming on,
hamlet@6856		Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
hamlet@6901		Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
hamlet@6940		But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
hamlet@6985	
hamlet@6986		[Re-enter Ghost]
hamlet@7004	
hamlet@7005		I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
hamlet@7057		If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
hamlet@7099		Speak to me:
hamlet@7113		If there be any good thing to be done,
hamlet@7153		That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
hamlet@7196		Speak to me:
hamlet@7210	
hamlet@7211		[Cock crows]
hamlet@7225	
hamlet@7226		If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
hamlet@7268		Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
hamlet@7318		Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
hamlet@7357		Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
hamlet@7398		For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
hamlet@7451		Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
hamlet@7502	
hamlet@7503	MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
hamlet@7552	
hamlet@7553	HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.
hamlet@7587	
hamlet@7588	BERNARDO	'Tis here!
hamlet@7608	
hamlet@7609	HORATIO	'Tis here!
hamlet@7628	
hamlet@7629	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!
hamlet@7650	
hamlet@7651		[Exit Ghost]
hamlet@7665	
hamlet@7666		We do it wrong, being so majestical,
hamlet@7704		To offer it the show of violence;
hamlet@7739		For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
hamlet@7777		And our vain blows malicious mockery.
hamlet@7816	
hamlet@7817	BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
hamlet@7869	
hamlet@7870	HORATIO	And then it started like a guilty thing
hamlet@7918		Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
hamlet@7957		The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
hamlet@8001		Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
hamlet@8049		Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
hamlet@8093		Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
hamlet@8135		The extravagant and erring spirit hies
hamlet@8175		To his confine: and of the truth herein
hamlet@8216		This present object made probation.
hamlet@8253	
hamlet@8254	MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
hamlet@8301		Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
hamlet@8347		Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
hamlet@8391		The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
hamlet@8436		And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
hamlet@8486		The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
hamlet@8537		No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
hamlet@8585		So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
hamlet@8627	
hamlet@8628	HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
hamlet@8679		But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
hamlet@8724		Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
hamlet@8771		Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
hamlet@8813		Let us impart what we have seen to-night
hamlet@8855		Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
hamlet@8894		This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
hamlet@8939		Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
hamlet@8986		As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
hamlet@9030	
hamlet@9031	MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
hamlet@9085		Where we shall find him most conveniently.

hamlet@9153	
hamlet@9154	ACT I
hamlet@9160	
hamlet@9161	
hamlet@9162	
hamlet@9163	SCENE II	A room of state in the castle.
hamlet@9203	
hamlet@9204	
hamlet@9205		[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
hamlet@9252		POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
hamlet@9301		and Attendants]
hamlet@9318	
hamlet@9319	KING CLAUDIUS	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
hamlet@9379		The memory be green, and that it us befitted
hamlet@9425		To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
hamlet@9476		To be contracted in one brow of woe,
hamlet@9514		Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
hamlet@9561		That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
hamlet@9603		Together with remembrance of ourselves.
hamlet@9644		Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
hamlet@9691		The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
hamlet@9738		Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
hamlet@9781		With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
hamlet@9821		With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
hamlet@9872		In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
hamlet@9917		Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
hamlet@9959		Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
hamlet@10004		With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
hamlet@10050		Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
hamlet@10097		Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
hamlet@10136		Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
hamlet@10182		Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
hamlet@10226		Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
hamlet@10271		He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
hamlet@10318		Importing the surrender of those lands
hamlet@10358		Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
hamlet@10402		To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
hamlet@10449		Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
hamlet@10496		Thus much the business is: we have here writ
hamlet@10542		To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
hamlet@10583		Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
hamlet@10626		Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
hamlet@10670		His further gait herein; in that the levies,
hamlet@10716		The lists and full proportions, are all made
hamlet@10762		Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
hamlet@10804		You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
hamlet@10846		For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
hamlet@10891		Giving to you no further personal power
hamlet@10932		To business with the king, more than the scope
hamlet@10980		Of these delated articles allow.
hamlet@11014		Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
hamlet@11063	
hamlet@11064	
hamlet@11065	CORNELIUS	|
hamlet@11077		|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
hamlet@11127	VOLTIMAND	|
hamlet@11139	
hamlet@11140	
hamlet@11141	KING CLAUDIUS	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
hamlet@11195	
hamlet@11196		[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@11230	
hamlet@11231		And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
hamlet@11276		You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
hamlet@11323		You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
hamlet@11364		And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
hamlet@11419		That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
hamlet@11464		The head is not more native to the heart,
hamlet@11507		The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
hamlet@11549		Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
hamlet@11595		What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
hamlet@11629	
hamlet@11630	LAERTES	My dread lord,
hamlet@11653		Your leave and favour to return to France;
hamlet@11697		From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
hamlet@11746		To show my duty in your coronation,
hamlet@11783		Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
hamlet@11825		My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
hamlet@11874		And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
hamlet@11923	
hamlet@11924	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
hamlet@11988	
hamlet@11989	LORD POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
hamlet@12049		By laboursome petition, and at last
hamlet@12086		Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
hamlet@12127		I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
hamlet@12168	
hamlet@12169	KING CLAUDIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
hamlet@12227		And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
hamlet@12270		But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
hamlet@12312	
hamlet@12313	HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
hamlet@12373	
hamlet@12374	KING CLAUDIUS	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
hamlet@12433	
hamlet@12434	HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
hamlet@12484	
hamlet@12485	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
hamlet@12542		And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
hamlet@12592		Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
hamlet@12630		Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
hamlet@12670		Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
hamlet@12722		Passing through nature to eternity.
hamlet@12759	
hamlet@12760	HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.
hamlet@12792	
hamlet@12793	QUEEN GERTRUDE	If it be,
hamlet@12818		Why seems it so particular with thee?
hamlet@12857	
hamlet@12858	HAMLET	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
hamlet@12910		'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
hamlet@12954		Nor customary suits of solemn black,
hamlet@12992		Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
hamlet@13033		No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
hamlet@13073		Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
hamlet@13114		Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
hamlet@13164		That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
hamlet@13210		For they are actions that a man might play:
hamlet@13255		But I have that within which passeth show;
hamlet@13299		These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
hamlet@13346	
hamlet@13347	KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
hamlet@13412		To give these mourning duties to your father:
hamlet@13459		But, you must know, your father lost a father;
hamlet@13507		That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
hamlet@13559		In filial obligation for some term
hamlet@13595		To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
hamlet@13637		In obstinate condolement is a course
hamlet@13675		Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
hamlet@13721		It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
hamlet@13764		A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
hamlet@13804		An understanding simple and unschool'd:
hamlet@13845		For what we know must be and is as common
hamlet@13888		As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
hamlet@13928		Why should we in our peevish opposition
hamlet@13969		Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
hamlet@14017		A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
hamlet@14063		To reason most absurd: whose common theme
hamlet@14106		Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
hamlet@14154		From the first corse till he that died to-day,
hamlet@14202		'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
hamlet@14250		This unprevailing woe, and think of us
hamlet@14290		As of a father: for let the world take note,
hamlet@14336		You are the most immediate to our throne;
hamlet@14379		And with no less nobility of love
hamlet@14414		Than that which dearest father bears his son,
hamlet@14461		Do I impart toward you. For your intent
hamlet@14502		In going back to school in Wittenberg,
hamlet@14542		It is most retrograde to our desire:
hamlet@14580		And we beseech you, bend you to remain
hamlet@14620		Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
hamlet@14664		Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

hamlet@14770		I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

hamlet@14821	HAMLET	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
hamlet@14868	
hamlet@14869	KING CLAUDIUS	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
hamlet@14920		Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
hamlet@14960		This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
hamlet@15003		Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
hamlet@15048		No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
hamlet@15094		But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
hamlet@15142		And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
hamlet@15193		Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

hamlet@15260	
hamlet@15261	HAMLET	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
hamlet@15312		Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
hamlet@15349		Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
hamlet@15388		His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
hamlet@15435		How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
hamlet@15477		Seem to me all the uses of this world!
hamlet@15517		Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
hamlet@15561		That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
hamlet@15614		Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
hamlet@15663		But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
hamlet@15712		So excellent a king; that was, to this,
hamlet@15753		Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
hamlet@15798		That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
hamlet@15844		Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
hamlet@15891		Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
hamlet@15937		As if increase of appetite had grown
hamlet@15975		By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
hamlet@16021		Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
hamlet@16075		A little month, or ere those shoes were old
hamlet@16120		With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
hamlet@16168		Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
hamlet@16213		O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
hamlet@16263		Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
hamlet@16314		My father's brother, but no more like my father
hamlet@16363		Than I to Hercules: within a month:
hamlet@16400		Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
hamlet@16444		Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
hamlet@16487		She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
hamlet@16531		With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
hamlet@16574		It is not nor it cannot come to good:
hamlet@16613		But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

hamlet@16772		Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
hamlet@16806	
hamlet@16807	HORATIO	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
hamlet@16862	
hamlet@16863	HAMLET	Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
hamlet@16923		And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
hamlet@16979	
hamlet@16980	MARCELLUS	My good lord--
hamlet@17005	
hamlet@17006	HAMLET	I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
hamlet@17056		But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
hamlet@17103	
hamlet@17104	HORATIO	A truant disposition, good my lord.
hamlet@17148	
hamlet@17149	HAMLET	I would not hear your enemy say so,
hamlet@17192		Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
hamlet@17234		To make it truster of your own report

hamlet@17356		We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
hamlet@17403	
hamlet@17404	HORATIO	My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
hamlet@17458	
hamlet@17459	HAMLET	I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
hamlet@17511		I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
hamlet@17555	
hamlet@17556	HORATIO	Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
hamlet@17604	
hamlet@17605	HAMLET	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
hamlet@17661		Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
hamlet@17708		Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
hamlet@17750		Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
hamlet@17789		My father!--methinks I see my father.

hamlet@17829	HORATIO	Where, my lord?
hamlet@17853	
hamlet@17854	HAMLET	                  In my mind's eye, Horatio.
hamlet@17906	
hamlet@17907	HORATIO	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
hamlet@17953	
hamlet@17954	HAMLET	He was a man, take him for all in all,
hamlet@18000		I shall not look upon his like again.
hamlet@18039	
hamlet@18040	HORATIO	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
hamlet@18088	
hamlet@18089	HAMLET	Saw? who?
hamlet@18106	
hamlet@18107	HORATIO	My lord, the king your father.
hamlet@18146	
hamlet@18147	HAMLET	The king my father!
hamlet@18174	
hamlet@18175	HORATIO	Season your admiration for awhile
hamlet@18217		With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
hamlet@18258		Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
hamlet@18296		This marvel to you.
hamlet@18317	
hamlet@18318	HAMLET	For God's love, let me hear.
hamlet@18354	
hamlet@18355	HORATIO	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
hamlet@18404		Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
hamlet@18445		In the dead vast and middle of the night,
hamlet@18488		Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
hamlet@18539		Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
hamlet@18574		Appears before them, and with solemn march
hamlet@18618		Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
hamlet@18667		By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
hamlet@18712		Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
hamlet@18767		Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
hamlet@18806		Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
hamlet@18851		In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
hamlet@18889		And I with them the third night kept the watch;
hamlet@18938		Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
hamlet@18983		Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
hamlet@19033		The apparition comes: I knew your father;
hamlet@19076		These hands are not more like.
hamlet@19108	
hamlet@19109	HAMLET	But where was this?
hamlet@19136	
hamlet@19137	MARCELLUS	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
hamlet@19192	
hamlet@19193	HAMLET	Did you not speak to it?
hamlet@19225	
hamlet@19226	HORATIO	My lord, I did;
hamlet@19250		But answer made it none: yet once methought
hamlet@19295		It lifted up its head and did address
hamlet@19334		Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
hamlet@19377		But even then the morning cock crew loud,
hamlet@19420		And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
hamlet@19463		And vanish'd from our sight.
hamlet@19493	
hamlet@19494	HAMLET	'Tis very strange.
hamlet@19520	
hamlet@19521	HORATIO	As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
hamlet@19572		And we did think it writ down in our duty
hamlet@19615		To let you know of it.
hamlet@19639	
hamlet@19640	HAMLET	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
hamlet@19691		Hold you the watch to-night?

hamlet@19929	
hamlet@19930	
hamlet@19931	HAMLET	Then saw you not his face?
hamlet@19965	
hamlet@19966	HORATIO	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
hamlet@20014	
hamlet@20015	HAMLET	What, look'd he frowningly?
hamlet@20050	
hamlet@20051	HORATIO	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
hamlet@20103	
hamlet@20104	HAMLET	Pale or red?
hamlet@20124	
hamlet@20125	HORATIO	Nay, very pale.
hamlet@20149	
hamlet@20150	HAMLET	                  And fix'd his eyes upon you?

hamlet@20282	
hamlet@20283	HORATIO	It would have much amazed you.
hamlet@20322	
hamlet@20323	HAMLET	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

hamlet@20502	HAMLET	                  His beard was grizzled--no?
hamlet@20555

hamlet@20603		A sable silver'd.
hamlet@20622	
hamlet@20623	HAMLET	                  I will watch to-night;

hamlet@20701	
hamlet@20702	HORATIO	I warrant it will.
hamlet@20729	
hamlet@20730	HAMLET	If it assume my noble father's person,
hamlet@20776		I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
hamlet@20826		And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
hamlet@20869		If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
hamlet@20913		Let it be tenable in your silence still;
hamlet@20955		And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
hamlet@20996		Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
hamlet@21038		I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
hamlet@21085		Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
hamlet@21131		I'll visit you.
hamlet@21148	
hamlet@21149	All	                  Our duty to your honour.
hamlet@21196	
hamlet@21197	HAMLET	Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

hamlet@21269		My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;

hamlet@21502	
hamlet@21503	
hamlet@21504	
hamlet@21505	SCENE III	A room in Polonius' house.
hamlet@21542	
hamlet@21543	
hamlet@21544		[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA]
hamlet@21573	
hamlet@21574	LAERTES	My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
hamlet@21621		And, sister, as the winds give benefit
hamlet@21661		And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
hamlet@21701		But let me hear from you.
hamlet@21728	
hamlet@21729	OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?
hamlet@21756	
hamlet@21757	LAERTES	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
hamlet@21808		Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
hamlet@21847		A violet in the youth of primy nature,
hamlet@21887		Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
hamlet@21932		The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
hamlet@21982	
hamlet@21983	OPHELIA	       No more but so?
hamlet@22014	
hamlet@22015	LAERTES	Think it no more;
hamlet@22041		For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
hamlet@22084		In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
hamlet@22131		The inward service of the mind and soul
hamlet@22172		Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
hamlet@22218		And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
hamlet@22260		The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
hamlet@22304		His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
hamlet@22353		For he himself is subject to his birth:
hamlet@22394		He may not, as unvalued persons do,
hamlet@22431		Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
hamlet@22477		The safety and health of this whole state;
hamlet@22521		And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
hamlet@22569		Unto the voice and yielding of that body
hamlet@22611		Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
hamlet@22666		It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
hamlet@22708		As he in his particular act and place
hamlet@22747		May give his saying deed; which is no further
hamlet@22794		Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
hamlet@22839		Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
hamlet@22886		If with too credent ear you list his songs,
hamlet@22931		Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
hamlet@22981		To his unmaster'd importunity.
hamlet@23013		Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
hamlet@23057		And keep you in the rear of your affection,
hamlet@23102		Out of the shot and danger of desire.
hamlet@23141		The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
hamlet@23180		If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
hamlet@23219		Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
hamlet@23266		The canker galls the infants of the spring,
hamlet@23311		Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
hamlet@23355		And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
hamlet@23396		Contagious blastments are most imminent.
hamlet@23438		Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
hamlet@23479		Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
hamlet@23527	
hamlet@23528	OPHELIA	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
hamlet@23581		As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
hamlet@23629		Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
hamlet@23669		Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
hamlet@23714		Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
hamlet@23761		Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
hamlet@23809		And recks not his own rede.
hamlet@23838	
hamlet@23839	LAERTES	O, fear me not.
hamlet@23863		I stay too long: but here my father comes.
hamlet@23907	
hamlet@23908		[Enter POLONIUS]
hamlet@23926	
hamlet@23927		A double blessing is a double grace,

hamlet@24003	
hamlet@24004	LORD POLONIUS	Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
hamlet@24064		The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
hamlet@24109		And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
hamlet@24164		And these few precepts in thy memory
hamlet@24202		See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
hamlet@24252		Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
hamlet@24293		Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
hamlet@24336		Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
hamlet@24388		Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
hamlet@24435		But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
hamlet@24480		Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
hamlet@24528		Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
hamlet@24569		Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
hamlet@24614		Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
hamlet@24658		Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
hamlet@24710		Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
hamlet@24750		But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
hamlet@24796		For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
hamlet@24836		And they in France of the best rank and station
hamlet@24885		Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
hamlet@24935		Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
hamlet@24972		For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
hamlet@25016		And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
hamlet@25060		This above all: to thine ownself be true,
hamlet@25103		And it must follow, as the night the day,
hamlet@25146		Thou canst not then be false to any man.
hamlet@25188		Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
hamlet@25232	
hamlet@25233	LAERTES	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
hamlet@25282	
hamlet@25283	LORD POLONIUS	The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
hamlet@25343	
hamlet@25344	LAERTES	Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
hamlet@25389		What I have said to you.
hamlet@25415	
hamlet@25416	OPHELIA	'Tis in my memory lock'd,
hamlet@25450		And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

hamlet@25522	
hamlet@25523	LORD POLONIUS	What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
hamlet@25578	
hamlet@25579	OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
hamlet@25638	
hamlet@25639	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:
hamlet@25676		'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
hamlet@25716		Given private time to you; and you yourself
hamlet@25761		Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
hamlet@25814		If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
hamlet@25850		And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
hamlet@25896		You do not understand yourself so clearly
hamlet@25939		As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
hamlet@25983		What is between you? give me up the truth.
hamlet@26027	
hamlet@26028	OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
hamlet@26080		Of his affection to me.
hamlet@26105	
hamlet@26106	LORD POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
hamlet@26166		Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
hamlet@26207		Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
hamlet@26254	
hamlet@26255	OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
hamlet@26308	
hamlet@26309	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
hamlet@26369		That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
hamlet@26418		Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
hamlet@26472		Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
hamlet@26519		Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
hamlet@26562	
hamlet@26563	OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importuned me with love
hamlet@26612		In honourable fashion.
hamlet@26636	
hamlet@26637	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
hamlet@26694	
hamlet@26695	OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
hamlet@26754		With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
hamlet@26796	
hamlet@26797	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
hamlet@26855		When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
hamlet@26900		Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
hamlet@26948		Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
hamlet@26995		Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
hamlet@27038		You must not take for fire. From this time
hamlet@27082		Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
hamlet@27128		Set your entreatments at a higher rate
hamlet@27168		Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
hamlet@27212		Believe so much in him, that he is young
hamlet@27254		And with a larger tether may he walk
hamlet@27292		Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
hamlet@27333		Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
hamlet@27381		Not of that dye which their investments show,
hamlet@27428		But mere implorators of unholy suits,
hamlet@27467		Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
hamlet@27511		The better to beguile. This is for all:
hamlet@27552		I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
hamlet@27604		Have you so slander any moment leisure,
hamlet@27645		As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
hamlet@27693		Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
hamlet@27735

hamlet@28063	HORATIO	Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
hamlet@28125		Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
hamlet@28168	
hamlet@28169		[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within]
hamlet@28226	
hamlet@28227		What does this mean, my lord?
hamlet@28258	
hamlet@28259	HAMLET	The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
hamlet@28315		Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
hamlet@28367		And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
hamlet@28416		The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
hamlet@28459		The triumph of his pledge.
hamlet@28487	
hamlet@28488	HORATIO	Is it a custom?
hamlet@28512	
hamlet@28513	HAMLET	Ay, marry, is't:
hamlet@28537		But to my mind, though I am native here
hamlet@28578		And to the manner born, it is a custom
hamlet@28618		More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
hamlet@28668		This heavy-headed revel east and west
hamlet@28707		Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
hamlet@28754		They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
hamlet@28804		Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
hamlet@28844		From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
hamlet@28896		The pith and marrow of our attribute.
hamlet@28935		So, oft it chances in particular men,
hamlet@28974		That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
hamlet@29021		As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
hamlet@29071		Since nature cannot choose his origin--
hamlet@29112		By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
hamlet@29151		Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
hamlet@29201		Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
hamlet@29246		The form of plausive manners, that these men,
hamlet@29293		Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
hamlet@29336		Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
hamlet@29381		Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
hamlet@29428		As infinite as man may undergo--
hamlet@29462		Shall in the general censure take corruption
hamlet@29508		From that particular fault: the dram of eale
hamlet@29554		Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
hamlet@29595		To his own scandal.
hamlet@29616	
hamlet@29617	HORATIO	Look, my lord, it comes!
hamlet@29650	
hamlet@29651		[Enter Ghost]
hamlet@29666	
hamlet@29667	HAMLET	Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
hamlet@29715		Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
hamlet@29761		Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
hamlet@29816		Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
hamlet@29854		Thou comest in such a questionable shape
hamlet@29896		That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
hamlet@29947		King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
hamlet@29988		Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
hamlet@30029		Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
hamlet@30073		Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
hamlet@30121		Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
hamlet@30159		Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
hamlet@30201		To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
hamlet@30245		That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
hamlet@30293		Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
hamlet@30336		Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
hamlet@30382		So horridly to shake our disposition
hamlet@30420		With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
hamlet@30468		Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
hamlet@30517	
hamlet@30518		[Ghost beckons HAMLET]
hamlet@30542	
hamlet@30543	HORATIO	It beckons you to go away with it,
hamlet@30586		As if it some impartment did desire
hamlet@30623		To you alone.
hamlet@30638	
hamlet@30639	MARCELLUS	                  Look, with what courteous action
hamlet@30700		It waves you to a more removed ground:
hamlet@30740		But do not go with it.
hamlet@30764	
hamlet@30765	HORATIO	No, by no means.
hamlet@30790	
hamlet@30791	HAMLET	It will not speak; then I will follow it.
hamlet@30840	
hamlet@30841	HORATIO	Do not, my lord.
hamlet@30866	
hamlet@30867	HAMLET	                  Why, what should be the fear?
hamlet@30922		I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
hamlet@30960		And for my soul, what can it do to that,
hamlet@31002		Being a thing immortal as itself?
hamlet@31037		It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
hamlet@31079	
hamlet@31080	HORATIO	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
hamlet@31136		Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
hamlet@31176		That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
hamlet@31218		And there assume some other horrible form,
hamlet@31262		Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
hamlet@31310		And draw you into madness? think of it:
hamlet@31351		The very place puts toys of desperation,
hamlet@31393		Without more motive, into every brain
hamlet@31432		That looks so many fathoms to the sea
hamlet@31471		And hears it roar beneath.
hamlet@31499	
hamlet@31500	HAMLET	It waves me still.
hamlet@31526		Go on; I'll follow thee.
hamlet@31552	
hamlet@31553	MARCELLUS	You shall not go, my lord.
hamlet@31590	
hamlet@31591	HAMLET	Hold off your hands.
hamlet@31619	
hamlet@31620	HORATIO	Be ruled; you shall not go.
hamlet@31656	
hamlet@31657	HAMLET	My fate cries out,
hamlet@31683		And makes each petty artery in this body
hamlet@31725		As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
hamlet@31763		Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
hamlet@31805		By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
hamlet@31856		I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
hamlet@31895	
hamlet@31896		[Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET]
hamlet@31923	
hamlet@31924	HORATIO	He waxes desperate with imagination.

hamlet@31970	MARCELLUS	Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
hamlet@32025	
hamlet@32026	HORATIO	Have after. To what issue will this come?
hamlet@32076	
hamlet@32077	MARCELLUS	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

hamlet@32358	
hamlet@32359	Ghost	Mark me.
hamlet@32374	
hamlet@32375	HAMLET	       I will.

hamlet@32398	Ghost	                  My hour is almost come,
hamlet@32446		When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
hamlet@32490		Must render up myself.
hamlet@32514	
hamlet@32515	HAMLET	Alas, poor ghost!
hamlet@32540	
hamlet@32541	Ghost	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
hamlet@32589		To what I shall unfold.
hamlet@32614	
hamlet@32615	HAMLET	Speak; I am bound to hear.
hamlet@32649	
hamlet@32650	Ghost	 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
hamlet@32703	
hamlet@32704	HAMLET	What?
hamlet@32717	
hamlet@32718	Ghost	I am thy father's spirit,
hamlet@32750		Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
hamlet@32796		And for the day confined to fast in fires,
hamlet@32840		Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
hamlet@32888		Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
hamlet@32937		To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
hamlet@32978		I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
hamlet@33021		Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
hamlet@33072		Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
hamlet@33130		Thy knotted and combined locks to part
hamlet@33170		And each particular hair to stand on end,
hamlet@33213		Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
hamlet@33255		But this eternal blazon must not be
hamlet@33292		To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
hamlet@33342		If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
hamlet@33385	
hamlet@33386	HAMLET	O God!
hamlet@33400	
hamlet@33401	Ghost	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
hamlet@33451	
hamlet@33452	HAMLET	Murder!
hamlet@33467	
hamlet@33468	Ghost	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
hamlet@33514		But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
hamlet@33558	
hamlet@33559	HAMLET	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
hamlet@33614		As meditation or the thoughts of love,
hamlet@33654		May sweep to my revenge.
hamlet@33680	
hamlet@33681	Ghost	I find thee apt;
hamlet@33704		And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
hamlet@33751		That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
hamlet@33794		Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
hamlet@33845		'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
hamlet@33891		A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
hamlet@33940		Is by a forged process of my death
hamlet@33976		Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
hamlet@34020		The serpent that did sting thy father's life
hamlet@34066		Now wears his crown.
hamlet@34088	
hamlet@34089	HAMLET	O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
hamlet@34127	
hamlet@34128	Ghost	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
hamlet@34178		With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
hamlet@34232		O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
hamlet@34277		So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
hamlet@34318		The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
hamlet@34363		O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
hamlet@34404		From me, whose love was of that dignity
hamlet@34445		That it went hand in hand even with the vow
hamlet@34490		I made to her in marriage, and to decline
hamlet@34533		Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
hamlet@34578		To those of mine!
hamlet@34597		But virtue, as it never will be moved,
hamlet@34637		Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
hamlet@34685		So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
hamlet@34729		Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
hamlet@34767		And prey on garbage.
hamlet@34789		But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
hamlet@34835		Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
hamlet@34881		My custom always of the afternoon,
hamlet@34917		Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
hamlet@34955		With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
hamlet@34996		And in the porches of my ears did pour
hamlet@35036		The leperous distilment; whose effect
hamlet@35075		Holds such an enmity with blood of man
hamlet@35115		That swift as quicksilver it courses through
hamlet@35161		The natural gates and alleys of the body,
hamlet@35204		And with a sudden vigour doth posset
hamlet@35242		And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
hamlet@35285		The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
hamlet@35332		And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
hamlet@35373		Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
hamlet@35422		All my smooth body.
hamlet@35443		Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
hamlet@35486		Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
hamlet@35536		Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
hamlet@35577		Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
hamlet@35614		No reckoning made, but sent to my account
hamlet@35657		With all my imperfections on my head:
hamlet@35696		O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
hamlet@35738		If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
hamlet@35781		Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
hamlet@35818		A couch for luxury and damned incest.
hamlet@35857		But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
hamlet@35897		Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
hamlet@35944		Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
hamlet@35991		And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
hamlet@36037		To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
hamlet@36086		The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
hamlet@36129		And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
hamlet@36170		Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

hamlet@36368		But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
hamlet@36408		Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
hamlet@36456		In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
hamlet@36498		Yea, from the table of my memory
hamlet@36532		I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
hamlet@36574		All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
hamlet@36625		That youth and observation copied there;
hamlet@36667		And thy commandment all alone shall live
hamlet@36709		Within the book and volume of my brain,
hamlet@36750		Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
hamlet@36794		O most pernicious woman!
hamlet@36820		O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
hamlet@36866		My tables,--meet it is I set it down,

hamlet@39934		Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
hamlet@39978		How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
hamlet@40020		As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
hamlet@40063		To put an antic disposition on,
hamlet@40096		That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
hamlet@40145		With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
hamlet@40192		Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
hamlet@40236		As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
hamlet@40294		Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
hamlet@40354		Or such ambiguous giving out, to note

hamlet@41250	REYNALDO	                  My lord, I did intend it.
hamlet@41303	
hamlet@41304	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
hamlet@41367		Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
hamlet@41413		And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
hamlet@41465		What company, at what expense; and finding
hamlet@41509		By this encompassment and drift of question
hamlet@41554		That they do know my son, come you more nearer
hamlet@41602		Than your particular demands will touch it:
hamlet@41647		Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
hamlet@41700		As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
hamlet@41746		And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
hamlet@41794	
hamlet@41795	REYNALDO	Ay, very well, my lord.
hamlet@41828	
hamlet@41829	LORD POLONIUS	'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
hamlet@41889		But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
hamlet@41930		Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
hamlet@41973		What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
hamlet@42021		As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
hamlet@42063		But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
hamlet@42108		As are companions noted and most known
hamlet@42148		To youth and liberty.
hamlet@42171	
hamlet@42172	REYNALDO	As gaming, my lord.
hamlet@42201	
hamlet@42202	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
hamlet@42265		Drabbing: you may go so far.
hamlet@42295	
hamlet@42296	REYNALDO	My lord, that would dishonour him.
hamlet@42340	
hamlet@42341	LORD POLONIUS	'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
hamlet@42402		You must not put another scandal on him,
hamlet@42444		That he is open to incontinency;
hamlet@42478		That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
hamlet@42537		That they may seem the taints of liberty,
hamlet@42580		The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
hamlet@42621		A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
hamlet@42657		Of general assault.
hamlet@42678	
hamlet@42679	REYNALDO	But, my good lord,--
hamlet@42709	
hamlet@42710	LORD POLONIUS	Wherefore should you do this?
hamlet@42754	
hamlet@42755	REYNALDO	Ay, my lord,
hamlet@42777		I would know that.
hamlet@42797	
hamlet@42798	LORD POLONIUS	                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;
hamlet@42859		And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
hamlet@42897		You laying these slight sullies on my son,
hamlet@42941		As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
hamlet@43002		Your party in converse, him you would sound,
hamlet@43048		Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
hamlet@43092		The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
hamlet@43137		He closes with you in this consequence;
hamlet@43178		'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
hamlet@43227		According to the phrase or the addition
hamlet@43268		Of man and country.
hamlet@43289	
hamlet@43290	REYNALDO	Very good, my lord.
hamlet@43319	
hamlet@43320	LORD POLONIUS	And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
hamlet@43383		about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
hamlet@43430		something: where did I leave?
hamlet@43461	
hamlet@43462	REYNALDO	At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
hamlet@43522		and 'gentleman.'
hamlet@43540	
hamlet@43541	LORD POLONIUS	At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
hamlet@43598		He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
hamlet@43638		I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
hamlet@43677		Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
hamlet@43733		There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
hamlet@43782		There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
hamlet@43827		'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
hamlet@43868		Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
hamlet@43904		See you now;
hamlet@43918		Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
hamlet@43968		And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
hamlet@44008		With windlasses and with assays of bias,
hamlet@44050		By indirections find directions out:
hamlet@44088		So by my former lecture and advice,
hamlet@44125		Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
hamlet@44171	
hamlet@44172	REYNALDO	My lord, I have.
hamlet@44198	
hamlet@44199	LORD POLONIUS	                  God be wi' you; fare you well.
hamlet@44262	
hamlet@44263	REYNALDO	Good my lord!
hamlet@44286	
hamlet@44287	LORD POLONIUS	Observe his inclination in yourself.
hamlet@44338	
hamlet@44339	REYNALDO	I shall, my lord.
hamlet@44366	
hamlet@44367	LORD POLONIUS	And let him ply his music.
hamlet@44408	
hamlet@44409	REYNALDO	Well, my lord.
hamlet@44433	
hamlet@44434	LORD POLONIUS	Farewell!
hamlet@44458	
hamlet@44459		[Exit REYNALDO]
hamlet@44476	
hamlet@44477		[Enter OPHELIA]
hamlet@44494	
hamlet@44495		How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
hamlet@44533	
hamlet@44534	OPHELIA	O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
hamlet@44590	
hamlet@44591	LORD POLONIUS	With what, i' the name of God?
hamlet@44636	
hamlet@44637	OPHELIA	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
hamlet@44684		Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
hamlet@44729		No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
hamlet@44774		Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
hamlet@44816		Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
hamlet@44867		And with a look so piteous in purport
hamlet@44906		As if he had been loosed out of hell
hamlet@44944		To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
hamlet@44987	
hamlet@44988	LORD POLONIUS	Mad for thy love?
hamlet@45020	
hamlet@45021	OPHELIA	                  My lord, I do not know;
hamlet@45071		But truly, I do fear it.
hamlet@45097	
hamlet@45098	LORD POLONIUS	What said he?
hamlet@45126	
hamlet@45127	OPHELIA	He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
hamlet@45177		Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
hamlet@45221		And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
hamlet@45267		He falls to such perusal of my face
hamlet@45304		As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
hamlet@45345		At last, a little shaking of mine arm
hamlet@45384		And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
hamlet@45430		He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
hamlet@45472		As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
hamlet@45512		And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
hamlet@45558		And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
hamlet@45604		He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
hamlet@45649		For out o' doors he went without their helps,
hamlet@45696		And, to the last, bended their light on me.
hamlet@45741	
hamlet@45742	LORD POLONIUS	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
hamlet@45799		This is the very ecstasy of love,
hamlet@45834		Whose violent property fordoes itself
hamlet@45873		And leads the will to desperate undertakings
hamlet@45919		As oft as any passion under heaven
hamlet@45955		That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
hamlet@45999		What, have you given him any hard words of late?
hamlet@46049	
hamlet@46050	OPHELIA	No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
hamlet@46101		I did repel his fetters and denied
hamlet@46137		His access to me.
hamlet@46156	
hamlet@46157	LORD POLONIUS	                  That hath made him mad.
hamlet@46213		I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
hamlet@46260		I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
hamlet@46311		And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
hamlet@46363		By heaven, it is as proper to our age
hamlet@46402		To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
hamlet@46444		As it is common for the younger sort
hamlet@46482		To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
hamlet@46528		This must be known; which, being kept close, might
hamlet@46580		move
hamlet@46586		More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

hamlet@46666	SCENE II	A room in the castle.
hamlet@46697	
hamlet@46698	
hamlet@46699		[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,
hamlet@46751		GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants]
hamlet@46782	
hamlet@46783	KING CLAUDIUS	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
hamlet@46841		Moreover that we much did long to see you,
hamlet@46885		The need we have to use you did provoke
hamlet@46926		Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
hamlet@46971		Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
hamlet@47012		Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
hamlet@47054		Resembles that it was. What it should be,
hamlet@47097		More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
hamlet@47151		So much from the understanding of himself,
hamlet@47195		I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
hamlet@47235		That, being of so young days brought up with him,
hamlet@47286		And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
hamlet@47336		That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
hamlet@47384		Some little time: so by your companies
hamlet@47424		To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
hamlet@47469		So much as from occasion you may glean,
hamlet@47510		Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
hamlet@47560		That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
hamlet@47599	
hamlet@47600	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
hamlet@47659		And sure I am two men there are not living
hamlet@47703		To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
hamlet@47751		To show us so much gentry and good will
hamlet@47792		As to expend your time with us awhile,
hamlet@47832		For the supply and profit of our hope,
hamlet@47872		Your visitation shall receive such thanks
hamlet@47915		As fits a king's remembrance.
hamlet@47946	
hamlet@47947	ROSENCRANTZ	Both your majesties
hamlet@47979		Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
hamlet@48026		Put your dread pleasures more into command
hamlet@48070		Than to entreaty.
hamlet@48089	
hamlet@48090	GUILDENSTERN	                  But we both obey,
hamlet@48139		And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
hamlet@48185		To lay our service freely at your feet,
hamlet@48226		To be commanded.
hamlet@48244	
hamlet@48245	KING CLAUDIUS	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
hamlet@48304	
hamlet@48305	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
hamlet@48365		And I beseech you instantly to visit
hamlet@48403		My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
hamlet@48446		And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
hamlet@48490	
hamlet@48491	GUILDENSTERN	Heavens make our presence and our practises
hamlet@48548		Pleasant and helpful to him!
hamlet@48578	
hamlet@48579	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Ay, amen!

hamlet@48650		Attendants]
hamlet@48663	
hamlet@48664		[Enter POLONIUS]
hamlet@48682	
hamlet@48683	LORD POLONIUS	The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
hamlet@48740		Are joyfully return'd.
hamlet@48764	
hamlet@48765	KING CLAUDIUS	Thou still hast been the father of good news.
hamlet@48825	
hamlet@48826	LORD POLONIUS	Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
hamlet@48881		I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
hamlet@48917		Both to my God and to my gracious king:
hamlet@48958		And I do think, or else this brain of mine
hamlet@49002		Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
hamlet@49041		As it hath used to do, that I have found
hamlet@49083		The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
hamlet@49119	
hamlet@49120	KING CLAUDIUS	O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
hamlet@49176	
hamlet@49177	LORD POLONIUS	Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
hamlet@49233		My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
hamlet@49282	
hamlet@49283	KING CLAUDIUS	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
hamlet@49342	
hamlet@49343		[Exit POLONIUS]
hamlet@49360	
hamlet@49361		He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
hamlet@49407		The head and source of all your son's distemper.
hamlet@49457	
hamlet@49458	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I doubt it is no other but the main;
hamlet@49510		His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
hamlet@49559	
hamlet@49560	KING CLAUDIUS	Well, we shall sift him.
hamlet@49599	
hamlet@49600		[Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@49651	
hamlet@49652			   Welcome, my good friends!
hamlet@49683		Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
hamlet@49730	
hamlet@49731	VOLTIMAND	Most fair return of greetings and desires.
hamlet@49784		Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
hamlet@49825		His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
hamlet@49869		To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
hamlet@49910		But, better look'd into, he truly found
hamlet@49951		It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
hamlet@49999		That so his sickness, age and impotence
hamlet@50040		Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
hamlet@50086		On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
hamlet@50129		Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
hamlet@50171		Makes vow before his uncle never more
hamlet@50210		To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
hamlet@50259		Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
hamlet@50299		Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
hamlet@50347		And his commission to employ those soldiers,
hamlet@50393		So levied as before, against the Polack:
hamlet@50435		With an entreaty, herein further shown,
hamlet@50476	
hamlet@50477		[Giving a paper]
hamlet@50495	
hamlet@50496		That it might please you to give quiet pass
hamlet@50541		Through your dominions for this enterprise,
hamlet@50586		On such regards of safety and allowance
hamlet@50627		As therein are set down.
hamlet@50653	
hamlet@50654	KING CLAUDIUS	It likes us well;
hamlet@50686		And at our more consider'd time well read,
hamlet@50730		Answer, and think upon this business.
hamlet@50769		Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
hamlet@50819		Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
hamlet@50868		Most welcome home!
hamlet@50888	
hamlet@50889		[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@50923	
hamlet@50924	LORD POLONIUS	                  This business is well ended.
hamlet@50985		My liege, and madam, to expostulate
hamlet@51022		What majesty should be, what duty is,
hamlet@51061		Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
hamlet@51109		Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
hamlet@51157		Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
hamlet@51203		And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
hamlet@51254		I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
hamlet@51295		Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
hamlet@51340		What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
hamlet@51383		But let that go.
hamlet@51401	
hamlet@51402	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  More matter, with less art.
hamlet@51463	
hamlet@51464	LORD POLONIUS	Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
hamlet@51514		That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
hamlet@51563		And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
hamlet@51607		But farewell it, for I will use no art.
hamlet@51648		Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
hamlet@51693		That we find out the cause of this effect,
hamlet@51737		Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
hamlet@51779		For this effect defective comes by cause:
hamlet@51822		Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
hamlet@51873		I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
hamlet@51918		Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
hamlet@51957		Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
hamlet@52003	
hamlet@52004		[Reads]
hamlet@52013	
hamlet@52014		'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
hamlet@52062		beautified Ophelia,'--
hamlet@52086		That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
hamlet@52140		a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
hamlet@52182	
hamlet@52183		[Reads]
hamlet@52192	
hamlet@52193		'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
hamlet@52237	
hamlet@52238	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Came this from Hamlet to her?
hamlet@52283	
hamlet@52284	LORD POLONIUS	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
hamlet@52343	
hamlet@52344		[Reads]
hamlet@52353	
hamlet@52354		'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
hamlet@52387		Doubt that the sun doth move;
hamlet@52418		Doubt truth to be a liar;
hamlet@52445		But never doubt I love.
hamlet@52470		'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
hamlet@52515		I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
hamlet@52561		I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
hamlet@52612		'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
hamlet@52652		this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
hamlet@52686		This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
hamlet@52734		And more above, hath his solicitings,
hamlet@52773		As they fell out by time, by means and place,
hamlet@52820		All given to mine ear.
hamlet@52844	
hamlet@52845	KING CLAUDIUS	But how hath she
hamlet@52876		Received his love?
hamlet@52896	
hamlet@52897	LORD POLONIUS	                  What do you think of me?
hamlet@52954	
hamlet@52955	KING CLAUDIUS	As of a man faithful and honourable.
hamlet@53006	
hamlet@53007	LORD POLONIUS	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
hamlet@53070		When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
hamlet@53115		As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
hamlet@53157		Before my daughter told me--what might you,
hamlet@53202		Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
hamlet@53246		If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
hamlet@53287		Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
hamlet@53332		Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
hamlet@53375		What might you think? No, I went round to work,
hamlet@53424		And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
hamlet@53467		'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
hamlet@53511		This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
hamlet@53561		That she should lock herself from his resort,
hamlet@53608		Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
hamlet@53649		Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
hamlet@53696		And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
hamlet@53738		Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
hamlet@53778		Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
hamlet@53822		Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
hamlet@53871		Into the madness wherein now he raves,
hamlet@53911		And all we mourn for.
hamlet@53934	
hamlet@53935	KING CLAUDIUS	Do you think 'tis this?
hamlet@53973	
hamlet@53974	QUEEN GERTRUDE	It may be, very likely.
hamlet@54013	
hamlet@54014	LORD POLONIUS	Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
hamlet@54078		That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
hamlet@54117		When it proved otherwise?
hamlet@54144	
hamlet@54145	KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I know.
hamlet@54176	
hamlet@54177	LORD POLONIUS	[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
hamlet@54227	
hamlet@54228		Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
hamlet@54272		If circumstances lead me, I will find
hamlet@54311		Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
hamlet@54358		Within the centre.
hamlet@54378	
hamlet@54379	KING CLAUDIUS	                  How may we try it further?
hamlet@54438	
hamlet@54439	LORD POLONIUS	You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
hamlet@54502		Here in the lobby.
hamlet@54522	
hamlet@54523	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  So he does indeed.
hamlet@54575	
hamlet@54576	LORD POLONIUS	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
hamlet@54636		Be you and I behind an arras then;
hamlet@54672		Mark the encounter: if he love her not
hamlet@54712		And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
hamlet@54756		Let me be no assistant for a state,
hamlet@54793		But keep a farm and carters.
hamlet@54823	
hamlet@54824	KING CLAUDIUS	We will try it.
hamlet@54854	
hamlet@54855	QUEEN GERTRUDE	But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
hamlet@54924	
hamlet@54925	LORD POLONIUS	Away, I do beseech you, both away:
hamlet@54974		I'll board him presently.

hamlet@55046		Attendants]

hamlet@55086			    O, give me leave:
hamlet@55110		How does my good Lord Hamlet?
hamlet@55141	
hamlet@55142	HAMLET	Well, God-a-mercy.
hamlet@55168	
hamlet@55169	LORD POLONIUS	Do you know me, my lord?
hamlet@55208	
hamlet@55209	HAMLET	Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
hamlet@55254	
hamlet@55255	LORD POLONIUS	Not I, my lord.
hamlet@55285	
hamlet@55286	HAMLET	Then I would you were so honest a man.
hamlet@55332	
hamlet@55333	LORD POLONIUS	Honest, my lord!
hamlet@55364	
hamlet@55365	HAMLET	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
hamlet@55424		one man picked out of ten thousand.
hamlet@55461	
hamlet@55462	LORD POLONIUS	That's very true, my lord.
hamlet@55503	
hamlet@55504	HAMLET	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
hamlet@55563		god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
hamlet@55607	
hamlet@55608	LORD POLONIUS	I have, my lord.
hamlet@55639	
hamlet@55640	HAMLET	Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
hamlet@55692		blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
hamlet@55742		Friend, look to 't.
hamlet@55763	
hamlet@55764	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my
hamlet@55828		daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
hamlet@55878		was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
hamlet@55927		truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
hamlet@55976		love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
hamlet@56024		What do you read, my lord?
hamlet@56052	
hamlet@56053	HAMLET	Words, words, words.
hamlet@56081	
hamlet@56082	LORD POLONIUS	What is the matter, my lord?
hamlet@56125	
hamlet@56126	HAMLET	Between who?
hamlet@56146	
hamlet@56147	LORD POLONIUS	I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
hamlet@56204	
hamlet@56205	HAMLET	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
hamlet@56261		that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
hamlet@56314		wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
hamlet@56360		plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
hamlet@56414		wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
hamlet@56466		though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
hamlet@56518		I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
hamlet@56571		yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
hamlet@56625		you could go backward.
hamlet@56649	
hamlet@56650	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method
hamlet@56717		in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
hamlet@56764	
hamlet@56765	HAMLET	Into my grave.
hamlet@56787	
hamlet@56788	LORD POLONIUS	Indeed, that is out o' the air.
hamlet@56834	
hamlet@56835		[Aside]
hamlet@56844	
hamlet@56845		How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
hamlet@56898		that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
hamlet@56951		could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
hamlet@57002		leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
hamlet@57049		meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
hamlet@57102		lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
hamlet@57150	
hamlet@57151	HAMLET	You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
hamlet@57210		more willingly part withal: except my life, except
hamlet@57262		my life, except my life.
hamlet@57288	
hamlet@57289	LORD POLONIUS	Fare you well, my lord.
hamlet@57327	
hamlet@57328	HAMLET	These tedious old fools!
hamlet@57360	
hamlet@57361		[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
hamlet@57399	
hamlet@57400	LORD POLONIUS	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
hamlet@57459	
hamlet@57460	ROSENCRANTZ	[To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!
hamlet@57506	
hamlet@57507		[Exit POLONIUS]
hamlet@57524	
hamlet@57525	GUILDENSTERN	My honoured lord!
hamlet@57556	
hamlet@57557	ROSENCRANTZ	My most dear lord!
hamlet@57588	
hamlet@57589	HAMLET	My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
hamlet@57638		Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
hamlet@57697	
hamlet@57698	ROSENCRANTZ	As the indifferent children of the earth.
hamlet@57752	
hamlet@57753	GUILDENSTERN	Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
hamlet@57804		On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
hamlet@57850	
hamlet@57851	HAMLET	Nor the soles of her shoe?
hamlet@57885	
hamlet@57886	ROSENCRANTZ	Neither, my lord.
hamlet@57916	
hamlet@57917	HAMLET	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
hamlet@57975		her favours?
hamlet@57989	
hamlet@57990	GUILDENSTERN	'Faith, her privates we.
hamlet@58028	
hamlet@58029	HAMLET	In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
hamlet@58086		is a strumpet. What's the news?
hamlet@58119	
hamlet@58120	ROSENCRANTZ	None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
hamlet@58182	
hamlet@58183	HAMLET	Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
hamlet@58240		Let me question more in particular: what have you,
hamlet@58292		my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
hamlet@58344		that she sends you to prison hither?
hamlet@58382	
hamlet@58383	GUILDENSTERN	Prison, my lord!
hamlet@58413	
hamlet@58414	HAMLET	Denmark's a prison.
hamlet@58441	
hamlet@58442	ROSENCRANTZ	Then is the world one.
hamlet@58477	
hamlet@58478	HAMLET	A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
hamlet@58533		wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
hamlet@58586	
hamlet@58587	ROSENCRANTZ	We think not so, my lord.
hamlet@58625	
hamlet@58626	HAMLET	Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
hamlet@58683		either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
hamlet@58736		it is a prison.
hamlet@58753	
hamlet@58754	ROSENCRANTZ	Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
hamlet@58813		narrow for your mind.
hamlet@58836	
hamlet@58837	HAMLET	O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
hamlet@58895		myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
hamlet@58948		have bad dreams.
hamlet@58966	
hamlet@58967	GUILDENSTERN	Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
hamlet@59027		substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
hamlet@59088	
hamlet@59089	HAMLET	A dream itself is but a shadow.
hamlet@59128	
hamlet@59129	ROSENCRANTZ	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
hamlet@59191		quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
hamlet@59234	
hamlet@59235	HAMLET	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
hamlet@59292		outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
hamlet@59344		to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
hamlet@59392	
hamlet@59393	
hamlet@59394	ROSENCRANTZ	|
hamlet@59408		| We'll wait upon you.
hamlet@59432	GUILDENSTERN	|
hamlet@59447	
hamlet@59448	
hamlet@59449	HAMLET	No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
hamlet@59506		of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
hamlet@59559		man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
hamlet@59608		beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
hamlet@59662	
hamlet@59663	ROSENCRANTZ	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
hamlet@59717	
hamlet@59718	HAMLET	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
hamlet@59775		thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
hamlet@59825		too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
hamlet@59877		your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
hamlet@59929		deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
hamlet@59975	
hamlet@59976	GUILDENSTERN	What should we say, my lord?
hamlet@60018	
hamlet@60019	HAMLET	Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
hamlet@60076		for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
hamlet@60130		which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
hamlet@60185		I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
hamlet@60236	
hamlet@60237	ROSENCRANTZ	To what end, my lord?
hamlet@60271	
hamlet@60272	HAMLET	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
hamlet@60330		the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
hamlet@60382		our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
hamlet@60434		love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
hamlet@60487		charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
hamlet@60535		whether you were sent for, or no?
hamlet@60570	
hamlet@60571	ROSENCRANTZ	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
hamlet@60622	
hamlet@60623	HAMLET	[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
hamlet@60680		love me, hold not off.
hamlet@60704	
hamlet@60705	GUILDENSTERN	My lord, we were sent for.
hamlet@60745	
hamlet@60746	HAMLET	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
hamlet@60799		prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
hamlet@60853		and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
hamlet@60902		wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
hamlet@60956		custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
hamlet@61008		with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
hamlet@61057		earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
hamlet@61109		excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
hamlet@61158		o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
hamlet@61211		with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
hamlet@61264		me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
hamlet@61319		What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
hamlet@61372		how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
hamlet@61421		express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
hamlet@61474		in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
hamlet@61525		world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
hamlet@61573		what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
hamlet@61626		me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
hamlet@61677		you seem to say so.
hamlet@61698	
hamlet@61699	ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
hamlet@61760	
hamlet@61761	HAMLET	Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
hamlet@61827	
hamlet@61828	ROSENCRANTZ	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
hamlet@61891		lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
hamlet@61944		you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
hamlet@61996		coming, to offer you service.
hamlet@62027	
hamlet@62028	HAMLET	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
hamlet@62088		shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
hamlet@62138		shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
hamlet@62190		sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
hamlet@62241		in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
hamlet@62291		lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
hamlet@62342		say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
hamlet@62394		for't. What players are they?
hamlet@62425	
hamlet@62426	ROSENCRANTZ	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
hamlet@62487		tragedians of the city.
hamlet@62512	
hamlet@62513	HAMLET	How chances it they travel? their residence, both
hamlet@62570		in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
hamlet@62619	
hamlet@62620	ROSENCRANTZ	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
hamlet@62683		late innovation.
hamlet@62701	
hamlet@62702	HAMLET	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
hamlet@62762		in the city? are they so followed?
hamlet@62798	
hamlet@62799	ROSENCRANTZ	No, indeed, are they not.
hamlet@62837	
hamlet@62838	HAMLET	How comes it? do they grow rusty?
hamlet@62879	
hamlet@62880	ROSENCRANTZ	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
hamlet@62943		there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
hamlet@62995		that cry out on the top of question, and are most
hamlet@63046		tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
hamlet@63093		fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
hamlet@63146		call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
hamlet@63198		goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
hamlet@63242	
hamlet@63243	HAMLET	What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
hamlet@63302		they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
hamlet@63349		longer than they can sing? will they not say
hamlet@63395		afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
hamlet@63449		players--as it is most like, if their means are no
hamlet@63501		better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
hamlet@63552		exclaim against their own succession?
hamlet@63591	
hamlet@63592	ROSENCRANTZ	'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
hamlet@63657		the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
hamlet@63702		controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
hamlet@63753		for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
hamlet@63807		cuffs in the question.
hamlet@63831	
hamlet@63832	HAMLET	Is't possible?
hamlet@63854	
hamlet@63855	GUILDENSTERN	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
hamlet@63917	
hamlet@63918	HAMLET	Do the boys carry it away?
hamlet@63952	
hamlet@63953	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
hamlet@64019	
hamlet@64020	HAMLET	It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
hamlet@64077		Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
hamlet@64131		my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
hamlet@64179		hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
hamlet@64230		'Sblood, there is something in this more than
hamlet@64277		natural, if philosophy could find it out.
hamlet@64320	
hamlet@64321		[Flourish of trumpets within]
hamlet@64352	
hamlet@64353	GUILDENSTERN	There are the players.
hamlet@64389	
hamlet@64390	HAMLET	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
hamlet@64449		come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
hamlet@64500		and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
hamlet@64552		lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
hamlet@64603		must show fairly outward, should more appear like
hamlet@64654		entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
hamlet@64705		uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
hamlet@64749	
hamlet@64750	GUILDENSTERN	In what, my dear lord?
hamlet@64786	
hamlet@64787	HAMLET	I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
hamlet@64842		southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
hamlet@64883	
hamlet@64884		[Enter POLONIUS]
hamlet@64902	
hamlet@64903	LORD POLONIUS	Well be with you, gentlemen!
hamlet@64946	
hamlet@64947	HAMLET	Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
hamlet@65005		hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
hamlet@65055		out of his swaddling-clouts.
hamlet@65085	
hamlet@65086	ROSENCRANTZ	Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
hamlet@65150		say an old man is twice a child.
hamlet@65184	
hamlet@65185	HAMLET	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
hamlet@65244		mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
hamlet@65293		'twas so indeed.
hamlet@65311	
hamlet@65312	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I have news to tell you.
hamlet@65360	
hamlet@65361	HAMLET	My lord, I have news to tell you.
hamlet@65402		When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
hamlet@65440	
hamlet@65441	LORD POLONIUS	The actors are come hither, my lord.
hamlet@65492	
hamlet@65493	HAMLET	Buz, buz!
hamlet@65510	
hamlet@65511	LORD POLONIUS	Upon mine honour,--
hamlet@65545	
hamlet@65546	HAMLET	Then came each actor on his ass,--
hamlet@65588	
hamlet@65589	LORD POLONIUS	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
hamlet@65653		comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
hamlet@65699		historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
hamlet@65752		comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
hamlet@65804		poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
hamlet@65853		Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
hamlet@65901		liberty, these are the only men.
hamlet@65935	
hamlet@65936	HAMLET	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
hamlet@66000	
hamlet@66001	LORD POLONIUS	What a treasure had he, my lord?
hamlet@66048	
hamlet@66049	HAMLET	Why,
hamlet@66061		'One fair daughter and no more,
hamlet@66094		The which he loved passing well.'
hamlet@66129	
hamlet@66130	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Still on my daughter.
hamlet@66175	
hamlet@66176	HAMLET	Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
hamlet@66220	
hamlet@66221	LORD POLONIUS	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
hamlet@66287		that I love passing well.
hamlet@66314	
hamlet@66315	HAMLET	Nay, that follows not.
hamlet@66345	
hamlet@66346	LORD POLONIUS	What follows, then, my lord?
hamlet@66389	
hamlet@66390	HAMLET	Why,
hamlet@66402		'As by lot, God wot,'
hamlet@66425		and then, you know,
hamlet@66446		'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
hamlet@66489		the first row of the pious chanson will show you
hamlet@66539		more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
hamlet@66584	
hamlet@66585		[Enter four or five Players]
hamlet@66615	
hamlet@66616		You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
hamlet@66667		to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
hamlet@66719		friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
hamlet@66772		comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
hamlet@66824		lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
hamlet@66872		nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
hamlet@66923		altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
hamlet@66974		apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
hamlet@67027		ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
hamlet@67075		to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
hamlet@67129		we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
hamlet@67182		of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
hamlet@67227	
hamlet@67228	First Player	What speech, my lord?
hamlet@67263	
hamlet@67264	HAMLET	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
hamlet@67319		never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
hamlet@67372		play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
hamlet@67422		caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
hamlet@67473		it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
hamlet@67522		cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
hamlet@67573		digested in the scenes, set down with as much
hamlet@67620		modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
hamlet@67668		were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
hamlet@67717		savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
hamlet@67766		indict the author of affectation; but called it an
hamlet@67818		honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
hamlet@67869		much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
hamlet@67919		chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
hamlet@67967		thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
hamlet@68016		Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
hamlet@68069		at this line: let me see, let me see--
hamlet@68109		'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
hamlet@68160		it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
hamlet@68202		'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
hamlet@68245		Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
hamlet@68291		When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
hamlet@68334		Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
hamlet@68384		With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
hamlet@68425		Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
hamlet@68466		With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
hamlet@68516		Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
hamlet@68563		That lend a tyrannous and damned light
hamlet@68603		To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
hamlet@68655		And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
hamlet@68697		With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
hamlet@68745		Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
hamlet@68774		So, proceed you.
hamlet@68792	
hamlet@68793	LORD POLONIUS	'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
hamlet@68861		good discretion.
hamlet@68879	
hamlet@68880	First Player	'Anon he finds him
hamlet@68912		Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
hamlet@68962		Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
hamlet@69007		Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
hamlet@69047		Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
hamlet@69095		But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
hamlet@69142		The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
hamlet@69192		Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
hamlet@69237		Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
hamlet@69283		Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
hamlet@69333		Which was declining on the milky head
hamlet@69372		Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
hamlet@69420		So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
hamlet@69461		And like a neutral to his will and matter,
hamlet@69505		Did nothing.
hamlet@69519		But, as we often see, against some storm,
hamlet@69562		A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
hamlet@69611		The bold winds speechless and the orb below
hamlet@69656		As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
hamlet@69701		Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
hamlet@69750		Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
hamlet@69790		And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
hamlet@69831		On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
hamlet@69873		With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
hamlet@69921		Now falls on Priam.

hamlet@70396	HAMLET	'The mobled queen?'
hamlet@70423	
hamlet@70424	LORD POLONIUS	That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.

hamlet@70476	First Player	'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
hamlet@70539		With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
hamlet@70582		Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
hamlet@70628		About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,

hamlet@70765		'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have

hamlet@70822		But if the gods themselves did see her then
hamlet@70867		When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
hamlet@70910		In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
hamlet@70958		The instant burst of clamour that she made,
hamlet@71003		Unless things mortal move them not at all,
hamlet@71047		Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,

hamlet@71125	
hamlet@71126	LORD POLONIUS	Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
hamlet@71191		tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
hamlet@71228	
hamlet@71229	HAMLET	'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
hamlet@71287		Good my lord, will you see the players well
hamlet@71332		bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
hamlet@71383		they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
hamlet@71434		time: after your death you were better have a bad
hamlet@71485		epitaph than their ill report while you live.
hamlet@71532	
hamlet@71533	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
hamlet@71599	
hamlet@71600	HAMLET	God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
hamlet@71655		after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
hamlet@71706		Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
hamlet@71760		they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
hamlet@71809		Take them in.
hamlet@71824	
hamlet@71825	LORD POLONIUS	Come, sirs.
hamlet@71851	
hamlet@71852	HAMLET	Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
hamlet@71909	
hamlet@71910		[Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First]
hamlet@71962	
hamlet@71963		Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
hamlet@72012		Murder of Gonzago?
hamlet@72032	
hamlet@72033	First Player	Ay, my lord.
hamlet@72059	
hamlet@72060	HAMLET	We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
hamlet@72118		study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
hamlet@72172		I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
hamlet@72222	
hamlet@72223	First Player	Ay, my lord.
hamlet@72249	
hamlet@72250	HAMLET	Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
hamlet@72308		not.

hamlet@72315		[Exit First Player]
hamlet@72336	
hamlet@72337		My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are

hamlet@72470	
hamlet@72471		[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
hamlet@72510	
hamlet@72511			  Now I am alone.
hamlet@72531		O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
hamlet@72572		Is it not monstrous that this player here,
hamlet@72616		But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
hamlet@72658		Could force his soul so to his own conceit
hamlet@72702		That from her working all his visage wann'd,
hamlet@72748		Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
hamlet@72793		A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
hamlet@72841		With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
hamlet@72890		For Hecuba!
hamlet@72903		What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
hamlet@72943		That he should weep for her? What would he do,
hamlet@72991		Had he the motive and the cue for passion
hamlet@73034		That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
hamlet@73084		And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
hamlet@73132		Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
hamlet@73173		Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
hamlet@73214		The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
hamlet@73259		A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
hamlet@73299		Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
hamlet@73344		And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
hamlet@73386		Upon whose property and most dear life
hamlet@73426		A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
hamlet@73468		Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
hamlet@73514		Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
hamlet@73561		Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
hamlet@73617		As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
hamlet@73661		Ha!
hamlet@73666		'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
hamlet@73712		But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
hamlet@73751		To make oppression bitter, or ere this
hamlet@73791		I should have fatted all the region kites
hamlet@73834		With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
hamlet@73883		Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
hamlet@73939		O, vengeance!
hamlet@73954		Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
hamlet@73998		That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
hamlet@74042		Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
hamlet@74086		Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
hamlet@74135		And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
hamlet@74174		A scullion!
hamlet@74187		Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
hamlet@74235		That guilty creatures sitting at a play
hamlet@74276		Have by the very cunning of the scene
hamlet@74315		Been struck so to the soul that presently
hamlet@74358		They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
hamlet@74400		For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
hamlet@74450		With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
hamlet@74503		Play something like the murder of my father
hamlet@74548		Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
hamlet@74592		I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
hamlet@74639		I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
hamlet@74686		May be the devil: and the devil hath power
hamlet@74730		To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
hamlet@74776		Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
hamlet@74815		As he is very potent with such spirits,
hamlet@74856		Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
hamlet@74897		More relative than this: the play 's the thing
hamlet@74945		Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

hamlet@75058

hamlet@75108		OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]
hamlet@75149	
hamlet@75150	KING CLAUDIUS	And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
hamlet@75206		Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
hamlet@75251		Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
hamlet@75293		With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
hamlet@75331	
hamlet@75332	ROSENCRANTZ	He does confess he feels himself distracted;
hamlet@75389		But from what cause he will by no means speak.
hamlet@75437	
hamlet@75438	GUILDENSTERN	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
hamlet@75493		But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
hamlet@75535		When we would bring him on to some confession
hamlet@75582		Of his true state.
hamlet@75602	
hamlet@75603	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  Did he receive you well?
hamlet@75661	
hamlet@75662	ROSENCRANTZ	Most like a gentleman.
hamlet@75697	
hamlet@75698	GUILDENSTERN	But with much forcing of his disposition.
hamlet@75753	
hamlet@75754	ROSENCRANTZ	Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
hamlet@75808		Most free in his reply.
hamlet@75833	
hamlet@75834	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Did you assay him?
hamlet@75868		To any pastime?
hamlet@75885	
hamlet@75886	ROSENCRANTZ	Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
hamlet@75942		We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
hamlet@75992		And there did seem in him a kind of joy
hamlet@76033		To hear of it: they are about the court,
hamlet@76075		And, as I think, they have already order
hamlet@76117		This night to play before him.
hamlet@76149	
hamlet@76150	LORD POLONIUS	'Tis most true:
hamlet@76180		And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
hamlet@76227		To hear and see the matter.
hamlet@76256	
hamlet@76257	KING CLAUDIUS	With all my heart; and it doth much content me
hamlet@76318		To hear him so inclined.
hamlet@76344		Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
hamlet@76386		And drive his purpose on to these delights.
hamlet@76431	
hamlet@76432	ROSENCRANTZ	We shall, my lord.

hamlet@76504	KING CLAUDIUS	                  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
hamlet@76566		For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
hamlet@76611		That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
hamlet@76653		Affront Ophelia:
hamlet@76671		Her father and myself, lawful espials,
hamlet@76711		Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
hamlet@76759		We may of their encounter frankly judge,
hamlet@76801		And gather by him, as he is behaved,
hamlet@76839		If 't be the affliction of his love or no
hamlet@76882		That thus he suffers for.
hamlet@76909	
hamlet@76910	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I shall obey you.
hamlet@76943		And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
hamlet@76982		That your good beauties be the happy cause

hamlet@77329		That show of such an exercise may colour
hamlet@77371		Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--

hamlet@77526	
hamlet@77527	KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!
hamlet@77576		How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
hamlet@77631		The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
hamlet@77682		Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
hamlet@77727		Than is my deed to my most painted word:
hamlet@77769		O heavy burthen!
hamlet@77787	
hamlet@77788	LORD POLONIUS	I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
hamlet@77846	
hamlet@77847		[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS]
hamlet@77884	
hamlet@77885		[Enter HAMLET]
hamlet@77901	
hamlet@77902	HAMLET	To be, or not to be: that is the question:
hamlet@77952		Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
hamlet@77995		The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
hamlet@78041		Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
hamlet@78085		And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
hamlet@78130		No more; and by a sleep to say we end
hamlet@78169		The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
hamlet@78217		That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
hamlet@78261		Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
hamlet@78303		To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
hamlet@78355		For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
hamlet@78404		When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
hamlet@78449		Must give us pause: there's the respect
hamlet@78490		That makes calamity of so long life;
hamlet@78528		For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
hamlet@78578		The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
hamlet@78629		The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
hamlet@78675		The insolence of office and the spurns
hamlet@78715		That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
hamlet@78758		When he himself might his quietus make
hamlet@78798		With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
hamlet@78843		To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
hamlet@78883		But that the dread of something after death,
hamlet@78929		The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
hamlet@78972		No traveller returns, puzzles the will
hamlet@79012		And makes us rather bear those ills we have
hamlet@79057		Than fly to others that we know not of?
hamlet@79098		Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
hamlet@79144		And thus the native hue of resolution
hamlet@79183		Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
hamlet@79232		And enterprises of great pith and moment
hamlet@79274		With this regard their currents turn awry,
hamlet@79318		And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
hamlet@79363		The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
hamlet@79404		Be all my sins remember'd.
hamlet@79432	
hamlet@79433	OPHELIA	Good my lord,
hamlet@79455		How does your honour for this many a day?
hamlet@79498	
hamlet@79499	HAMLET	I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
hamlet@79544	
hamlet@79545	OPHELIA	My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
hamlet@79592		That I have longed long to re-deliver;
hamlet@79632		I pray you, now receive them.
hamlet@79663	
hamlet@79664	HAMLET	No, not I;
hamlet@79682		I never gave you aught.
hamlet@79707	
hamlet@79708	OPHELIA	My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
hamlet@79763		And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
hamlet@79814		As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
hamlet@79865		Take these again; for to the noble mind
hamlet@79906		Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
hamlet@79953		There, my lord.
hamlet@79970	
hamlet@79971	HAMLET	Ha, ha! are you honest?
hamlet@80002	
hamlet@80003	OPHELIA	My lord?
hamlet@80020	
hamlet@80021	HAMLET	Are you fair?
hamlet@80042	
hamlet@80043	OPHELIA	What means your lordship?
hamlet@80077	
hamlet@80078	HAMLET	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
hamlet@80137		admit no discourse to your beauty.
hamlet@80173	
hamlet@80174	OPHELIA	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
hamlet@80231		with honesty?
hamlet@80246	
hamlet@80247	HAMLET	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
hamlet@80301		transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
hamlet@80355		force of honesty can translate beauty into his
hamlet@80403		likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
hamlet@80455		time gives it proof. I did love you once.
hamlet@80498	
hamlet@80499	OPHELIA	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
hamlet@80548	
hamlet@80549	HAMLET	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
hamlet@80607		so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
hamlet@80658		it: I loved you not.
hamlet@80680	
hamlet@80681	OPHELIA	I was the more deceived.
hamlet@80714	
hamlet@80715	HAMLET	Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
hamlet@80767		breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
hamlet@80820		but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
hamlet@80870		were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
hamlet@80921		proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
hamlet@80974		my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
hamlet@81020		imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
hamlet@81073		in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
hamlet@81120		between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
hamlet@81169		all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
hamlet@81221		Where's your father?
hamlet@81243	
hamlet@81244	OPHELIA	At home, my lord.
hamlet@81270	
hamlet@81271	HAMLET	Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
hamlet@81331		fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
hamlet@81376	
hamlet@81377	OPHELIA	O, help him, you sweet heavens!
hamlet@81417	
hamlet@81418	HAMLET	If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
hamlet@81476		thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
hamlet@81525		snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
hamlet@81577		nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
hamlet@81624		marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
hamlet@81676		what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
hamlet@81727		and quickly too. Farewell.
hamlet@81755	
hamlet@81756	OPHELIA	O heavenly powers, restore him!
hamlet@81796	
hamlet@81797	HAMLET	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
hamlet@81857		has given you one face, and you make yourselves
hamlet@81906		another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
hamlet@81954		nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
hamlet@82007		your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
hamlet@82058		made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
hamlet@82111		those that are married already, all but one, shall
hamlet@82163		live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
hamlet@82208		nunnery, go.

hamlet@82384		The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
hamlet@82429		The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
hamlet@82480		And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
hamlet@82524		That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
hamlet@82566		Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
hamlet@82613		Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
hamlet@82663		That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth

hamlet@83000		O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
hamlet@83042		And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
hamlet@83085		Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
hamlet@83129		I have in quick determination
hamlet@83160		Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
hamlet@83211		For the demand of our neglected tribute
hamlet@83252		Haply the seas and countries different
hamlet@83292		With variable objects shall expel
hamlet@83327		This something-settled matter in his heart,
hamlet@83372		Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
hamlet@83420		From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
hamlet@83467	
hamlet@83468	LORD POLONIUS	It shall do well: but yet do I believe
hamlet@83521		The origin and commencement of his grief
hamlet@83563		Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
hamlet@83610		You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
hamlet@83655		We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
hamlet@83700		But, if you hold it fit, after the play
hamlet@83741		Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
hamlet@83785		To show his grief: let her be round with him;
hamlet@83832		And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
hamlet@83879		Of all their conference. If she find him not,
hamlet@83926		To England send him, or confine him where
hamlet@83969		Your wisdom best shall think.

hamlet@84334		town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air

hamlet@84594		offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
hamlet@84639		periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
hamlet@84691		very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
hamlet@84745		for the most part are capable of nothing but
hamlet@84791		inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
hamlet@84844		a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
hamlet@84890		out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
hamlet@84929	
hamlet@84930	First Player	I warrant your honour.
hamlet@84966	
hamlet@84967	HAMLET	Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
hamlet@85027		be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
hamlet@85076		word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
hamlet@85128		the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
hamlet@85181		from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
hamlet@85234		first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
hamlet@85286		mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
hamlet@85340		scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
hamlet@85391		the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
hamlet@85443		or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
hamlet@85492		laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
hamlet@85542		censure of the which one must in your allowance
hamlet@85591		o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
hamlet@85641		players that I have seen play, and heard others
hamlet@85690		praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
hamlet@85743		that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
hamlet@85794		the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
hamlet@85842		strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
hamlet@85893		nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
hamlet@85945		well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
hamlet@85990	
hamlet@85991	First Player	I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
hamlet@86056		sir.
hamlet@86062	
hamlet@86063	HAMLET	O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
hamlet@86119		your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
hamlet@86173		for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
hamlet@86226		set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
hamlet@86278		too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
hamlet@86325		question of the play be then to be considered:
hamlet@86373		that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
hamlet@86426		in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

hamlet@86930	HAMLET	Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
hamlet@86974		As e'er my conversation coped withal.
hamlet@87013	
hamlet@87014	HORATIO	O, my dear lord,--
hamlet@87041	
hamlet@87042	HAMLET	                  Nay, do not think I flatter;
hamlet@87096		For what advancement may I hope from thee
hamlet@87139		That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
hamlet@87183		To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
hamlet@87243		No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
hamlet@87289		And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
hamlet@87332		Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
hamlet@87382		Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
hamlet@87429		And could of men distinguish, her election
hamlet@87473		Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
hamlet@87523		As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
hamlet@87572		A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
hamlet@87614		Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
hamlet@87665		Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
hamlet@87715		That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
hamlet@87762		To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
hamlet@87811		That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
hamlet@87861		In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
hamlet@87908		As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
hamlet@87954		There is a play to-night before the king;
hamlet@87997		One scene of it comes near the circumstance
hamlet@88042		Which I have told thee of my father's death:
hamlet@88088		I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
hamlet@88132		Even with the very comment of thy soul
hamlet@88172		Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
hamlet@88215		Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
hamlet@88254		It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
hamlet@88295		And my imaginations are as foul
hamlet@88328		As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
hamlet@88372		For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
hamlet@88413		And after we will both our judgments join
hamlet@88456		In censure of his seeming.
hamlet@88484	
hamlet@88485	HORATIO	Well, my lord:
hamlet@88508		If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
hamlet@88560		And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
hamlet@88605	
hamlet@88606	HAMLET	They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
hamlet@88658		Get you a place.

hamlet@88803	KING CLAUDIUS	How fares our cousin Hamlet?
hamlet@88846	
hamlet@88847	HAMLET	Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
hamlet@88906		the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

hamlet@88961	KING CLAUDIUS	I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words

hamlet@89070		[To POLONIUS]

hamlet@89086		My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
hamlet@89140	
hamlet@89141	LORD POLONIUS	That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
hamlet@89208	
hamlet@89209	HAMLET	What did you enact?
hamlet@89236	
hamlet@89237	LORD POLONIUS	I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
hamlet@89298		Capitol; Brutus killed me.
hamlet@89326	
hamlet@89327	HAMLET	It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
hamlet@89387		there. Be the players ready?
hamlet@89417	
hamlet@89418	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
hamlet@89473	
hamlet@89474	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
hamlet@89529	
hamlet@89530	HAMLET	No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.

hamlet@89585	LORD POLONIUS	[To KING CLAUDIUS]  O, ho! do you mark that?

hamlet@90031	
hamlet@90032	OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
hamlet@90053	
hamlet@90054	HAMLET	O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
hamlet@90110		but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
hamlet@90158		mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
hamlet@90216	
hamlet@90217	OPHELIA	Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
hamlet@90262	
hamlet@90263	HAMLET	So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
hamlet@90319		I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
hamlet@90367		months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
hamlet@90416		hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
hamlet@90469		a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
hamlet@90518		then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with

hamlet@90896		upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,

hamlet@91194		seeming to lament with her. The dead body is

hamlet@91645	OPHELIA	Will he tell us what this show meant?
hamlet@91691

hamlet@92094	
hamlet@92095		[Enter two Players, King and Queen]
hamlet@92132	
hamlet@92133	Player King	   Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
hamlet@92196		Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
hamlet@92243		And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
hamlet@92287		About the world have times twelve thirties been,
hamlet@92337		Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
hamlet@92384		Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
hamlet@92423	
hamlet@92424	Player Queen	   So many journeys may the sun and moon
hamlet@92478		Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
hamlet@92522		But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
hamlet@92564		So far from cheer and from your former state,
hamlet@92611		That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
hamlet@92657		Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
hamlet@92700		For women's fear and love holds quantity;
hamlet@92743		In neither aught, or in extremity.
hamlet@92779		Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
hamlet@92828		And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
hamlet@92869		Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
hamlet@92921		Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
hamlet@92977	
hamlet@92978	Player King	'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
hamlet@93040		My operant powers their functions leave to do:
hamlet@93088		And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
hamlet@93136		Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
hamlet@93178		For husband shalt thou--
hamlet@93204	
hamlet@93205	Player Queen	O, confound the rest!
hamlet@93240		Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
hamlet@93287		In second husband let me be accurst!
hamlet@93325		None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
hamlet@93372	
hamlet@93373	HAMLET	[Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.
hamlet@93409	
hamlet@93410	Player Queen	   The instances that second marriage move
hamlet@93466		Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
hamlet@93514		A second time I kill my husband dead,
hamlet@93553		When second husband kisses me in bed.
hamlet@93592	
hamlet@93593	Player King	   I do believe you think what now you speak;
hamlet@93651		But what we do determine oft we break.
hamlet@93691		Purpose is but the slave to memory,
hamlet@93728		Of violent birth, but poor validity;
hamlet@93766		Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
hamlet@93817		But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
hamlet@93859		Most necessary 'tis that we forget
hamlet@93895		To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
hamlet@93940		What to ourselves in passion we propose,
hamlet@93982		The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
hamlet@94026		The violence of either grief or joy
hamlet@94063		Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
hamlet@94109		Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
hamlet@94157		Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
hamlet@94204		This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
hamlet@94253		That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
hamlet@94307		For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
hamlet@94350		Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
hamlet@94400		The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
hamlet@94451		The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
hamlet@94496		And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
hamlet@94537		For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
hamlet@94583		And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
hamlet@94626		Directly seasons him his enemy.
hamlet@94659		But, orderly to end where I begun,
hamlet@94695		Our wills and fates do so contrary run
hamlet@94735		That our devices still are overthrown;
hamlet@94775		Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
hamlet@94827		So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
hamlet@94870		But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
hamlet@94921	
hamlet@94922	Player Queen	   Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
hamlet@94983		Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
hamlet@95029		To desperation turn my trust and hope!
hamlet@95069		An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
hamlet@95111		Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
hamlet@95154		Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
hamlet@95199		Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
hamlet@95246		If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
hamlet@95281	
hamlet@95282	HAMLET	If she should break it now!
hamlet@95317	
hamlet@95318	Player King	'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
hamlet@95378		My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
hamlet@95426		The tedious day with sleep.
hamlet@95455	
hamlet@95456		[Sleeps]
hamlet@95466	
hamlet@95467	Player Queen	Sleep rock thy brain,
hamlet@95502		And never come mischance between us twain!

hamlet@95555	
hamlet@95556	HAMLET	Madam, how like you this play?
hamlet@95594	
hamlet@95595	QUEEN GERTRUDE	The lady protests too much, methinks.
hamlet@95648	
hamlet@95649	HAMLET	O, but she'll keep her word.
hamlet@95685	
hamlet@95686	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
hamlet@95756	
hamlet@95757	HAMLET	No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
hamlet@95817		i' the world.
hamlet@95832	
hamlet@95833	KING CLAUDIUS	What do you call the play?
hamlet@95874	
hamlet@95875	HAMLET	The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
hamlet@95932		is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
hamlet@95985		the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
hamlet@96037		anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
hamlet@96086		that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
hamlet@96138		touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
hamlet@96186		withers are unwrung.
hamlet@96208

hamlet@96318

hamlet@96376		could see the puppets dallying.
hamlet@96409	
hamlet@96410	OPHELIA	You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
hamlet@96455	
hamlet@96456	HAMLET	It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
hamlet@96513	
hamlet@96514	OPHELIA	Still better, and worse.
hamlet@96547	
hamlet@96548	HAMLET	So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
hamlet@96604		pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
hamlet@96653		'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
hamlet@96700	
hamlet@96701	LUCIANUS	   Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
hamlet@96770		Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
hamlet@96816		Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
hamlet@96865		With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
hamlet@96917		Thy natural magic and dire property,
hamlet@96955		On wholesome life usurp immediately.
hamlet@96993	
hamlet@96994		[Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears]
hamlet@97038	
hamlet@97039	HAMLET	He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
hamlet@97093		name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
hamlet@97143		choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
hamlet@97196		gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
hamlet@97230	
hamlet@97231	OPHELIA	The king rises.
hamlet@97255	
hamlet@97256	HAMLET	What, frighted with false fire!
hamlet@97295	
hamlet@97296	QUEEN GERTRUDE	How fares my lord?
hamlet@97330	
hamlet@97331	LORD POLONIUS	Give o'er the play.
hamlet@97365	
hamlet@97366	KING CLAUDIUS	Give me some light: away!

hamlet@97473	
hamlet@97474	HAMLET	     Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
hamlet@97522		The hart ungalled play;
hamlet@97547		For some must watch, while some must sleep:
hamlet@97592		So runs the world away.
hamlet@97617		Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
hamlet@97669		the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
hamlet@97722		Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
hamlet@97768		fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
hamlet@97806	
hamlet@97807	HORATIO	Half a share.
hamlet@97829	
hamlet@97830	HAMLET	A whole one, I.
hamlet@97853		For thou dost know, O Damon dear,

hamlet@97953		A very, very--pajock.
hamlet@97976	
hamlet@97977	HORATIO	You might have rhymed.
hamlet@98008	
hamlet@98009	HAMLET	O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
hamlet@98065		thousand pound. Didst perceive?
hamlet@98098	
hamlet@98099	HORATIO	Very well, my lord.
hamlet@98127	
hamlet@98128	HAMLET	Upon the talk of the poisoning?
hamlet@98167	
hamlet@98168	HORATIO	I did very well note him.
hamlet@98202	
hamlet@98203	HAMLET	Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
hamlet@98257		For if the king like not the comedy,
hamlet@98295		Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
hamlet@98338		Come, some music!

hamlet@98549	GUILDENSTERN	Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
hamlet@98607	
hamlet@98608	HAMLET	With drink, sir?
hamlet@98632	
hamlet@98633	GUILDENSTERN	No, my lord, rather with choler.
hamlet@98679

hamlet@98851	
hamlet@98852	GUILDENSTERN	Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
hamlet@98918		start not so wildly from my affair.
hamlet@98955	
hamlet@98956	HAMLET	I am tame, sir: pronounce.
hamlet@98990	
hamlet@98991	GUILDENSTERN	The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
hamlet@99056		spirit, hath sent me to you.
hamlet@99086	
hamlet@99087	HAMLET	You are welcome.
hamlet@99111	
hamlet@99112	GUILDENSTERN	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
hamlet@99178		breed. If it shall please you to make me a
hamlet@99222		wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
hamlet@99265		commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
hamlet@99313		shall be the end of my business.
hamlet@99347	
hamlet@99348	HAMLET	Sir, I cannot.
hamlet@99370	
hamlet@99371	GUILDENSTERN	What, my lord?
hamlet@99399	
hamlet@99400	HAMLET	Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
hamlet@99460		sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
hamlet@99512		or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
hamlet@99561		more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
hamlet@99609	
hamlet@99610	ROSENCRANTZ	Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
hamlet@99672		into amazement and admiration.
hamlet@99704	
hamlet@99705	HAMLET	O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
hamlet@99764		is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
hamlet@99814		admiration? Impart.
hamlet@99835	
hamlet@99836	ROSENCRANTZ	She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
hamlet@99901		go to bed.
hamlet@99913	
hamlet@99914	HAMLET	We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
hamlet@99972		you any further trade with us?
hamlet@100004	
hamlet@100005	ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you once did love me.
hamlet@100048	
hamlet@100049	HAMLET	So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
hamlet@100102	
hamlet@100103	ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
hamlet@100166		do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
hamlet@100218		you deny your griefs to your friend.
hamlet@100256	
hamlet@100257	HAMLET	Sir, I lack advancement.
hamlet@100289	
hamlet@100290	ROSENCRANTZ	How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
hamlet@100355		himself for your succession in Denmark?
hamlet@100396	
hamlet@100397	HAMLET	Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
hamlet@100455		is something musty.

hamlet@100512	
hamlet@100513		O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
hamlet@100565		you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
hamlet@100619		as if you would drive me into a toil?
hamlet@100658	
hamlet@100659	GUILDENSTERN	O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
hamlet@100723		unmannerly.
hamlet@100736	
hamlet@100737	HAMLET	I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
hamlet@100794		this pipe?
hamlet@100806	
hamlet@100807	GUILDENSTERN	My lord, I cannot.
hamlet@100839	
hamlet@100840	HAMLET	I pray you.

hamlet@100896	HAMLET	I do beseech you.
hamlet@100921	
hamlet@100922	GUILDENSTERN	I know no touch of it, my lord.
hamlet@100967	
hamlet@100968	HAMLET	'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
hamlet@101025		your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
hamlet@101075		mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
hamlet@101126		Look you, these are the stops.
hamlet@101158	
hamlet@101159	GUILDENSTERN	But these cannot I command to any utterance of
hamlet@101219		harmony; I have not the skill.
hamlet@101251	
hamlet@101252	HAMLET	Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
hamlet@101311		me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
hamlet@101363		my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
hamlet@101410		mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
hamlet@101462		the top of my compass: and there is much music,
hamlet@101511		excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
hamlet@101562		you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
hamlet@101609		easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
hamlet@101659		instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
hamlet@101713		cannot play upon me.

hamlet@101915	
hamlet@101916	LORD POLONIUS	By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
hamlet@101974	
hamlet@101975	HAMLET	Methinks it is like a weasel.
hamlet@102012	
hamlet@102013	LORD POLONIUS	It is backed like a weasel.

hamlet@102080	
hamlet@102081	LORD POLONIUS	Very like a whale.
hamlet@102114

hamlet@103637		The lives of many. The cease of majesty
hamlet@103678		Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
hamlet@103723		What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
hamlet@103769		Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
hamlet@103812		To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
hamlet@103861		Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,

hamlet@104438		And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
hamlet@104481		'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,

hamlet@104752	
hamlet@104753		O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
hamlet@104797		It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
hamlet@104838		A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
hamlet@104875		Though inclination be as sharp as will:
hamlet@104916		My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
hamlet@104961		And, like a man to double business bound,
hamlet@105004		I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
hamlet@105049		And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
hamlet@105093		Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
hamlet@105141		Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
hamlet@105188		To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
hamlet@105236		But to confront the visage of offence?
hamlet@105276		And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
hamlet@105323		To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
hamlet@105363		Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
hamlet@105407		My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
hamlet@105454		Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
hamlet@105503		That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
hamlet@105547		Of those effects for which I did the murder,
hamlet@105593		My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
hamlet@105636		May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
hamlet@105681		In the corrupted currents of this world
hamlet@105722		Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
hamlet@105767		And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
hamlet@105810		Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
hamlet@105852		There is no shuffling, there the action lies
hamlet@105898		In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
hamlet@105947		Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
hamlet@105994		To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
hamlet@106039		Try what repentance can: what can it not?
hamlet@106082		Yet what can it when one can not repent?
hamlet@106124		O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
hamlet@106167		O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
hamlet@106211		Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
hamlet@106256		Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
hamlet@106312		Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!

hamlet@106552		A villain kills my father; and for that,
hamlet@106594		I, his sole son, do this same villain send
hamlet@106638		To heaven.
hamlet@106650		O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
hamlet@106692		He took my father grossly, full of bread;
hamlet@106735		With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
hamlet@106786		And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
hamlet@106835		But in our circumstance and course of thought,
hamlet@106883		'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
hamlet@106929		To take him in the purging of his soul,
hamlet@106970		When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
hamlet@107016		No!
hamlet@107021		Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
hamlet@107067		When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
hamlet@107109		Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
hamlet@107152		At gaming, swearing, or about some act
hamlet@107192		That has no relish of salvation in't;
hamlet@107231		Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
hamlet@107282		And that his soul may be as damn'd and black

hamlet@110432	HAMLET	Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
hamlet@110482		The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
hamlet@110528		See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
hamlet@110572		Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
hamlet@110618		An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
hamlet@110662		A station like the herald Mercury
hamlet@110697		New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
hamlet@110736		A combination and a form indeed,
hamlet@110770		Where every god did seem to set his seal,
hamlet@110813		To give the world assurance of a man:
hamlet@110852		This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
hamlet@110904		Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
hamlet@110948		Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
hamlet@110996		Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
hamlet@111044		And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
hamlet@111089		You cannot call it love; for at your age
hamlet@111131		The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
hamlet@111179		And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
hamlet@111227		Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
hamlet@111281		Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
hamlet@111335		Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
hamlet@111377		Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
hamlet@111421		But it reserved some quantity of choice,
hamlet@111463		To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
hamlet@111512		That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
hamlet@111558		Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
hamlet@111604		Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
hamlet@111652		Or but a sickly part of one true sense
hamlet@111692		Could not so mope.
hamlet@111712		O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
hamlet@111759		If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
hamlet@111802		To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
hamlet@111842		And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
hamlet@111887		When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,

hamlet@111975		And reason panders will.
hamlet@112001	
hamlet@112002	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, speak no more:
hamlet@112042		Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
hamlet@112085		And there I see such black and grained spots
hamlet@112131		As will not leave their tinct.
hamlet@112163	
hamlet@112164	HAMLET	Nay, but to live
hamlet@112188		In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
hamlet@112227		Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
hamlet@112275		Over the nasty sty,--
hamlet@112298	
hamlet@112299	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O, speak to me no more;
hamlet@112338		These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
hamlet@112386		No more, sweet Hamlet!
hamlet@112410	
hamlet@112411	HAMLET	A murderer and a villain;
hamlet@112444		A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
hamlet@112490		Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
hamlet@112532		A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
hamlet@112572		That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
hamlet@112618		And put it in his pocket!
hamlet@112645	
hamlet@112646	QUEEN GERTRUDE	No more!
hamlet@112670	
hamlet@112671	HAMLET	A king of shreds and patches,--
hamlet@112710	
hamlet@112711		[Enter Ghost]
hamlet@112726	
hamlet@112727		Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
hamlet@112772		You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
hamlet@112827	
hamlet@112828	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, he's mad!
hamlet@112859	
hamlet@112860	HAMLET	Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
hamlet@112908		That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
hamlet@112954		The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
hamlet@113007	
hamlet@113008	Ghost	Do not forget: this visitation
hamlet@113045		Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
hamlet@113089		But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
hamlet@113131		O, step between her and her fighting soul:
hamlet@113175		Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
hamlet@113219		Speak to her, Hamlet.
hamlet@113242	
hamlet@113243	HAMLET	How is it with you, lady?
hamlet@113276	
hamlet@113277	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, how is't with you,
hamlet@113317		That you do bend your eye on vacancy
hamlet@113355		And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
hamlet@113403		Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
hamlet@113449		And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
hamlet@113494		Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
hamlet@113538		Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
hamlet@113583		Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
hamlet@113625		Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
hamlet@113671	
hamlet@113672	HAMLET	On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
hamlet@113725		His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
hamlet@113777		Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
hamlet@113824		Lest with this piteous action you convert
hamlet@113867		My stern effects: then what I have to do
hamlet@113909		Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
hamlet@113960	
hamlet@113961	QUEEN GERTRUDE	To whom do you speak this?
hamlet@114003	
hamlet@114004	HAMLET	Do you see nothing there?
hamlet@114037	
hamlet@114038	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
hamlet@114092	
hamlet@114093	HAMLET	Nor did you nothing hear?
hamlet@114126	
hamlet@114127	QUEEN GERTRUDE	No, nothing but ourselves.
hamlet@114169	
hamlet@114170	HAMLET	Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
hamlet@114224		My father, in his habit as he lived!

hamlet@114313	
hamlet@114314		[Exit Ghost]

hamlet@114329	QUEEN GERTRUDE	This the very coinage of your brain:
hamlet@114381		This bodiless creation ecstasy
hamlet@114413		Is very cunning in.
hamlet@114434	
hamlet@114435	HAMLET	Ecstasy!
hamlet@114451		My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
hamlet@114500		And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
hamlet@114549		That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
hamlet@114593		And I the matter will re-word; which madness
hamlet@114639		Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
hamlet@114686		Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
hamlet@114732		That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
hamlet@114780		It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
hamlet@114827		Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
hamlet@114871		Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
hamlet@114916		Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
hamlet@114960		And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
hamlet@115005		To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
hamlet@115054		For in the fatness of these pursy times
hamlet@115095		Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
hamlet@115135		Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
hamlet@115180	
hamlet@115181	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
hamlet@115241	
hamlet@115242	HAMLET	O, throw away the worser part of it,
hamlet@115286		And live the purer with the other half.
hamlet@115327		Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
hamlet@115372		Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
hamlet@115410		That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
hamlet@115457		Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
hamlet@115497		That to the use of actions fair and good
hamlet@115539		He likewise gives a frock or livery,
hamlet@115577		That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
hamlet@115618		And that shall lend a kind of easiness
hamlet@115658		To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
hamlet@115703		For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
hamlet@115751		And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out
hamlet@115803		With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
hamlet@115850		And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
hamlet@115892		I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
hamlet@115939	
hamlet@115940		[Pointing to POLONIUS]
hamlet@115964	
hamlet@115965		I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
hamlet@116010		To punish me with this and this with me,
hamlet@116052		That I must be their scourge and minister.
hamlet@116096		I will bestow him, and will answer well
hamlet@116137		The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
hamlet@116183		I must be cruel, only to be kind:
hamlet@116218		Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
hamlet@116261		One word more, good lady.
hamlet@116288	
hamlet@116289	QUEEN GERTRUDE	What shall I do?
hamlet@116321	
hamlet@116322	HAMLET	Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
hamlet@116371		Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
hamlet@116415		Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
hamlet@116464		And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
hamlet@116507		Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
hamlet@116558		Make you to ravel all this matter out,
hamlet@116598		That I essentially am not in madness,
hamlet@116637		But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
hamlet@116686		For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
hamlet@116735		Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
hamlet@116777		Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
hamlet@116823		No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
hamlet@116861		Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
hamlet@116899		Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
hamlet@116945		To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
hamlet@116987		And break your own neck down.
hamlet@117018	
hamlet@117019	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
hamlet@117079		And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
hamlet@117126		What thou hast said to me.
hamlet@117154	
hamlet@117155	HAMLET	I must to England; you know that?
hamlet@117196	
hamlet@117197	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alack,
hamlet@117219		I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
hamlet@117256	
hamlet@117257	HAMLET	There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
hamlet@117314		Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
hamlet@117358		They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
hamlet@117406		And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
hamlet@117447		For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
hamlet@117488		Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
hamlet@117537		But I will delve one yard below their mines,
hamlet@117583		And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
hamlet@117631		When in one line two crafts directly meet.
hamlet@117675		This man shall set me packing:
hamlet@117707		I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
hamlet@117751		Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
hamlet@117795		Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
hamlet@117843		Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
hamlet@117885		Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.

hamlet@118410	KING CLAUDIUS	What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
hamlet@118457	
hamlet@118458	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
hamlet@118516		Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
hamlet@118560		Behind the arras hearing something stir,
hamlet@118602		Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
hamlet@118648		And, in this brainish apprehension, kills

hamlet@118717	
hamlet@118718	KING CLAUDIUS	O heavy deed!

hamlet@121033	
hamlet@121034	HAMLET	Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
hamlet@121092		rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
hamlet@121144		king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
hamlet@121195		an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
hamlet@121248		be last swallowed: when he needs what you have

hamlet@122908		worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
hamlet@122956		creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for

hamlet@126094

hamlet@126141		We go to gain a little patch of ground
hamlet@126181		That hath in it no profit but the name.
hamlet@126222		To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;

hamlet@127020		Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
hamlet@127070		Looking before and after, gave us not
hamlet@127109		That capability and god-like reason

hamlet@127230		Of thinking too precisely on the event,
hamlet@127271		A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
hamlet@127325		And ever three parts coward, I do not know
hamlet@127369		Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
hamlet@127414		Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
hamlet@127465		To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
hamlet@127510		Witness this army of such mass and charge
hamlet@127553		Led by a delicate and tender prince,
hamlet@127591		Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
hamlet@127633		Makes mouths at the invisible event,
hamlet@127671		Exposing what is mortal and unsure
hamlet@127707		To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
hamlet@127752		Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
hamlet@127796		Is not to stir without great argument,
hamlet@127836		But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
hamlet@127876		When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
hamlet@127923		That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
hamlet@127969		Excitements of my reason and my blood,
hamlet@128009		And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
hamlet@128055		The imminent death of twenty thousand men,

hamlet@131707		When sorrows come, they come not single spies
hamlet@131754		But in battalions. First, her father slain:
hamlet@131799		Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
hamlet@131848		Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
hamlet@131893		Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
hamlet@131948		For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
hamlet@132005		In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
hamlet@132050		Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
hamlet@132095		Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
hamlet@132147		Last, and as much containing as all these,
hamlet@132191		Her brother is in secret come from France;
hamlet@132235		Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
hamlet@132282		And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
hamlet@132323		With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
hamlet@132371		Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
hamlet@132411		Will nothing stick our person to arraign
hamlet@132453		In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
hamlet@132496		Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
hamlet@132539		Gives me superfluous death.

hamlet@132815		Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
hamlet@132861		Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,

hamlet@133738	LAERTES	That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,

hamlet@134015		Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
hamlet@134062		There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
hamlet@134104		That treason can but peep to what it would,
hamlet@134149		Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,

hamlet@134432		To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
hamlet@134483		Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
hamlet@134530		I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
hamlet@134572		That both the worlds I give to negligence,
hamlet@134616		Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
hamlet@134660		Most thoroughly for my father.
hamlet@134692

hamlet@134764		And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
hamlet@134810		They shall go far with little.
hamlet@134842	
hamlet@134843	KING CLAUDIUS	Good Laertes,
hamlet@134871		If you desire to know the certainty
hamlet@134908		Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
hamlet@134965		That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
hamlet@135019		Winner and loser?
hamlet@135038	
hamlet@135039	LAERTES	None but his enemies.
hamlet@135069	
hamlet@135070	KING CLAUDIUS	Will you know them then?
hamlet@135109	
hamlet@135110	LAERTES	To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
hamlet@135166		And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
hamlet@135209		Repast them with my blood.
hamlet@135237	
hamlet@135238	KING CLAUDIUS	Why, now you speak
hamlet@135271		Like a good child and a true gentleman.
hamlet@135312		That I am guiltless of your father's death,
hamlet@135357		And am most sensible in grief for it,
hamlet@135396		It shall as level to your judgment pierce
hamlet@135439		As day does to your eye.

hamlet@140664		Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--

hamlet@140928		Is the great love the general gender bear him;
hamlet@140976		Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,

hamlet@143886		Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
hamlet@143930		Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
hamlet@143981		Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
hamlet@144018		I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
hamlet@144069		And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
hamlet@144119		Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;

hamlet@144644		For art and exercise in your defence
hamlet@144682		And for your rapier most especially,
hamlet@144720		That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
hamlet@144767		If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,

hamlet@145221	
hamlet@145222	LAERTES	Why ask you this?
hamlet@145248	
hamlet@145249	KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I think you did not love your father;
hamlet@145310		But that I know love is begun by time;
hamlet@145350		And that I see, in passages of proof,
hamlet@145389		Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
hamlet@145431		There lives within the very flame of love
hamlet@145474		A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
hamlet@145519		And nothing is at a like goodness still;
hamlet@145561		For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
hamlet@145598		Dies in his own too much: that we would do
hamlet@145642		We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
hamlet@145696		And hath abatements and delays as many
hamlet@145736		As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
hamlet@145785		And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
hamlet@145837		That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
hamlet@145894		Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
hamlet@145940		To show yourself your father's son in deed
hamlet@145984		More than in words?
hamlet@146005	
hamlet@146006	LAERTES	To cut his throat i' the church.
hamlet@146047	
hamlet@146048	KING CLAUDIUS	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;

hamlet@146158		Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
hamlet@146209		Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:

hamlet@146305		And set a double varnish on the fame
hamlet@146343		The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
hamlet@146395		And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
hamlet@146439		Most generous and free from all contriving,
hamlet@146484		Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
hamlet@146532		Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
hamlet@146576		A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
hamlet@146620		Requite him for your father.
hamlet@146650	
hamlet@146651	LAERTES	I will do't:
hamlet@146672		And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
hamlet@146718		I bought an unction of a mountebank,
hamlet@146756		So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
hamlet@146796		Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
hamlet@146840		Collected from all simples that have virtue
hamlet@146885		Under the moon, can save the thing from death

hamlet@147035		It may be death.

hamlet@150489		a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
hamlet@150540		Christian burial.
hamlet@150559	
hamlet@150560	First Clown	Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
hamlet@150619		great folk should have countenance in this world to
hamlet@150672		drown or hang themselves, more than their even
hamlet@150720		Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
hamlet@150768		gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
hamlet@150822		they hold up Adam's profession.
hamlet@150855	
hamlet@150856	Second Clown	Was he a gentleman?
hamlet@150889	
hamlet@150890	First Clown	He was the first that ever bore arms.
hamlet@150940	
hamlet@150941	Second Clown	Why, he had none.
hamlet@150972	
hamlet@150973	First Clown	What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
hamlet@151035		Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
hamlet@151081		could he dig without arms? I'll put another
hamlet@151126		question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
hamlet@151177		purpose, confess thyself--
hamlet@151205	
hamlet@151206	Second Clown	Go to.
hamlet@151226	
hamlet@151227	First Clown	What is he that builds stronger than either the
hamlet@151287		mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
hamlet@151329	
hamlet@151330	Second Clown	The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
hamlet@151388		thousand tenants.
hamlet@151407	
hamlet@151408	First Clown	I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
hamlet@151468		does well; but how does it well? it does well to
hamlet@151518		those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
hamlet@151566		gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
hamlet@151617		the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
hamlet@151669	
hamlet@151670	Second Clown	'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
hamlet@151735		a carpenter?'
hamlet@151750	
hamlet@151751	First Clown	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
hamlet@151793	
hamlet@151794	Second Clown	Marry, now I can tell.
hamlet@151830	
hamlet@151831	First Clown	To't.
hamlet@151849	
hamlet@151850	Second Clown	Mass, I cannot tell.

hamlet@152858		how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
hamlet@152911		Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
hamlet@152959		might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
hamlet@153010		now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
hamlet@153060		might it not?
hamlet@153075	
hamlet@153076	HORATIO	It might, my lord.
hamlet@153103	
hamlet@153104	HAMLET	Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,

hamlet@153944		suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
hamlet@153995		sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
hamlet@154049		his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
hamlet@154099		in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
hamlet@154152		his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,

hamlet@155526	HAMLET	How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
hamlet@155581		card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
hamlet@155631		Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
hamlet@155682		it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
hamlet@155734		peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
hamlet@155786		gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
hamlet@155829		grave-maker?
hamlet@155843	
hamlet@155844	First Clown	Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
hamlet@155906		that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
hamlet@155954	
hamlet@155955	HAMLET	How long is that since?
hamlet@155986	
hamlet@155987	First Clown	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
hamlet@156050		was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
hamlet@156104		is mad, and sent into England.
hamlet@156136	
hamlet@156137	HAMLET	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
hamlet@156185	
hamlet@156186	First Clown	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
hamlet@156249		there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
hamlet@156303	
hamlet@156304	HAMLET	Why?
hamlet@156316	
hamlet@156317	First Clown	'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
hamlet@156379		are as mad as he.
hamlet@156398	
hamlet@156399	HAMLET	How came he mad?
hamlet@156423	
hamlet@156424	First Clown	Very strangely, they say.
hamlet@156462

hamlet@156485	
hamlet@156486	First Clown	Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
hamlet@156532	
hamlet@156533	HAMLET	Upon what ground?
hamlet@156558	
hamlet@156559	First Clown	Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
hamlet@156622		and boy, thirty years.
hamlet@156646	
hamlet@156647	HAMLET	How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
hamlet@156703	
hamlet@156704	First Clown	I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
hamlet@156767		have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hamlet@156820		hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
hamlet@156874		or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
hamlet@156923	
hamlet@156924	HAMLET	Why he more than another?
hamlet@156957	
hamlet@156958	First Clown	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
hamlet@157023		he will keep out water a great while; and your water
hamlet@157077		is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
hamlet@157124		Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
hamlet@157178		three and twenty years.
hamlet@157203	
hamlet@157204	HAMLET	Whose was it?
hamlet@157225	
hamlet@157226	First Clown	A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
hamlet@157297	
hamlet@157298	HAMLET	Nay, I know not.
hamlet@157322	
hamlet@157323	First Clown	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
hamlet@157384		flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
hamlet@157437		sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
hamlet@157482	
hamlet@157483	HAMLET	This?
hamlet@157496	
hamlet@157497	First Clown	E'en that.

hamlet@157521	HAMLET	Let me see.
hamlet@157540	
hamlet@157541		[Takes the skull]
hamlet@157560	
hamlet@157561		Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
hamlet@157611		of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
hamlet@157663		borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
hamlet@157716		abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
hamlet@157768		it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
hamlet@157820		not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
hamlet@157864		gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
hamlet@157913		that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
hamlet@157965		now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
hamlet@158017		Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
hamlet@158070		her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
hamlet@158120		come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
hamlet@158174		me one thing.

hamlet@158338		[Puts down the skull]
hamlet@158361	
hamlet@158362	HORATIO	E'en so, my lord.
hamlet@158388	
hamlet@158389	HAMLET	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
hamlet@158446		not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
hamlet@158498		till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
hamlet@158537	
hamlet@158538	HORATIO	'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
hamlet@158596	
hamlet@158597	HAMLET	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
hamlet@158657		modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
hamlet@158704		thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
hamlet@158749		Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
hamlet@158803		earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
hamlet@158857		was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
hamlet@158908		Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
hamlet@158952		Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
hamlet@158994		O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
hamlet@159044		Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
hamlet@159091		But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.

hamlet@159636	
hamlet@159637	First Priest	Her obsequies have been as far enlarged

hamlet@159788		She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
hamlet@159835		Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,

hamlet@160046	
hamlet@160047	LAERTES	Must there no more be done?
hamlet@160083	
hamlet@160084	First Priest	No more be done:

hamlet@163353	
hamlet@163354	
hamlet@163355	
hamlet@163356	SCENE II	A hall in the castle.
hamlet@163387	
hamlet@163388	
hamlet@163389		[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO]
hamlet@163417	
hamlet@163418	HAMLET	So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
hamlet@163477		You do remember all the circumstance?
hamlet@163516	
hamlet@163517	HORATIO	Remember it, my lord?
hamlet@163547	
hamlet@163548	HAMLET	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
hamlet@163602		That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
hamlet@163648		Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
hamlet@163696		And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
hamlet@163742		Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
hamlet@163786		When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
hamlet@163841		There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
hamlet@163883		Rough-hew them how we will,--
hamlet@163914	
hamlet@163915	HORATIO	That is most certain.
hamlet@163945	
hamlet@163946	HAMLET	Up from my cabin,
hamlet@163971		My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
hamlet@164014		Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
hamlet@164057		Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
hamlet@164102		To mine own room again; making so bold,
hamlet@164143		My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
hamlet@164183		Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
hamlet@164234		O royal knavery!--an exact command,
hamlet@164271		Larded with many several sorts of reasons
hamlet@164314		Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
hamlet@164361		With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
hamlet@164406		That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
hamlet@164449		No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
hamlet@164491		My head should be struck off.
hamlet@164522	
hamlet@164523	HORATIO	Is't possible?
hamlet@164546	
hamlet@164547	HAMLET	Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
hamlet@164602		But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
hamlet@164644	
hamlet@164645	HORATIO	I beseech you.
hamlet@164668	
hamlet@164669	HAMLET	Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
hamlet@164721		Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
hamlet@164764		They had begun the play--I sat me down,
hamlet@164805		Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
hamlet@164847		I once did hold it, as our statists do,
hamlet@164888		A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
hamlet@164932		How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
hamlet@164976		It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
hamlet@165020		The effect of what I wrote?
hamlet@165049	
hamlet@165050	HORATIO	Ay, good my lord.
hamlet@165076	
hamlet@165077	HAMLET	An earnest conjuration from the king,
hamlet@165122		As England was his faithful tributary,
hamlet@165162		As love between them like the palm might flourish,
hamlet@165214		As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
hamlet@165262		And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
hamlet@165303		And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
hamlet@165347		That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
hamlet@165397		Without debatement further, more or less,
hamlet@165440		He should the bearers put to sudden death,
hamlet@165484		Not shriving-time allow'd.
hamlet@165512	
hamlet@165513	HORATIO	How was this seal'd?
hamlet@165542	
hamlet@165543	HAMLET	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
hamlet@165589		I had my father's signet in my purse,
hamlet@165628		Which was the model of that Danish seal;
hamlet@165670		Folded the writ up in form of the other,
hamlet@165712		Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
hamlet@165769		The changeling never known. Now, the next day
hamlet@165816		Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
hamlet@165865		Thou know'st already.
hamlet@165888	
hamlet@165889	HORATIO	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
hamlet@165938	
hamlet@165939	HAMLET	Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
hamlet@165995		They are not near my conscience; their defeat
hamlet@166042		Does by their own insinuation grow:
hamlet@166079		'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
hamlet@166123		Between the pass and fell incensed points
hamlet@166166		Of mighty opposites.
hamlet@166188	
hamlet@166189	HORATIO	Why, what a king is this!
hamlet@166223	
hamlet@166224	HAMLET	Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
hamlet@166279		He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
hamlet@166330		Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
hamlet@166376		Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
hamlet@166418		And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
hamlet@166472		To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
hamlet@166527		To let this canker of our nature come
hamlet@166566		In further evil?
hamlet@166584	
hamlet@166585	HORATIO	It must be shortly known to him from England
hamlet@166638		What is the issue of the business there.
hamlet@166680	
hamlet@166681	HAMLET	It will be short: the interim is mine;
hamlet@166727		And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
hamlet@166774		But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
hamlet@166810		That to Laertes I forgot myself;
hamlet@166844		For, by the image of my cause, I see
hamlet@166882		The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
hamlet@166931		But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
hamlet@166979		Into a towering passion.
hamlet@167005	
hamlet@167006	HORATIO	Peace! who comes here?
hamlet@167037	
hamlet@167038		[Enter OSRIC]
hamlet@167053	
hamlet@167054	OSRIC	Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
hamlet@167108	
hamlet@167109	HAMLET	I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
hamlet@167167	
hamlet@167168	HORATIO	No, my good lord.
hamlet@167194	
hamlet@167195	HAMLET	Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
hamlet@167253		know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
hamlet@167302		beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
hamlet@167356		the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
hamlet@167404		spacious in the possession of dirt.
hamlet@167441	
hamlet@167442	OSRIC	Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
hamlet@167496		should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
hamlet@167544	
hamlet@167545	HAMLET	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
hamlet@167598		spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
hamlet@167660	
hamlet@167661	OSRIC	I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
hamlet@167706	
hamlet@167707	HAMLET	No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
hamlet@167758		northerly.
hamlet@167770	
hamlet@167771	OSRIC	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
hamlet@167818	
hamlet@167819	HAMLET	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
hamlet@167876		complexion.
hamlet@167889	
hamlet@167890	OSRIC	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
hamlet@167941		'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
hamlet@167988		majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
hamlet@168039		great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
hamlet@168093	
hamlet@168094	HAMLET	I beseech you, remember--
hamlet@168127	
hamlet@168128		[HAMLET moves him to put on his hat]
hamlet@168166	
hamlet@168167	OSRIC	Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
hamlet@168222		Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
hamlet@168273		me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
hamlet@168324		differences, of very soft society and great showing:
hamlet@168378		indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
hamlet@168432		calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
hamlet@168483		continent of what part a gentleman would see.
hamlet@168530	
hamlet@168531	HAMLET	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
hamlet@168587		though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
hamlet@168638		dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
hamlet@168687		neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
hamlet@168739		verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
hamlet@168788		great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
hamlet@168840		rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
hamlet@168888		semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
hamlet@168939		him, his umbrage, nothing more.
hamlet@168972	
hamlet@168973	OSRIC	Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
hamlet@169024	
hamlet@169025	HAMLET	The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
hamlet@169083		in our more rawer breath?
hamlet@169110	
hamlet@169111	OSRIC	Sir?
hamlet@169122	
hamlet@169123	HORATIO	Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
hamlet@169182		You will do't, sir, really.
hamlet@169211	
hamlet@169212	HAMLET	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
hamlet@169266	
hamlet@169267	OSRIC	Of Laertes?
hamlet@169285	
hamlet@169286	HORATIO	His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
hamlet@169352	
hamlet@169353	HAMLET	Of him, sir.
hamlet@169373	
hamlet@169374	OSRIC	I know you are not ignorant--
hamlet@169410	
hamlet@169411	HAMLET	I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
hamlet@169467		it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
hamlet@169509	
hamlet@169510	OSRIC	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
hamlet@169569	
hamlet@169570	HAMLET	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
hamlet@169629		him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
hamlet@169682		know himself.
hamlet@169697	
hamlet@169698	OSRIC	I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
hamlet@169755		laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
hamlet@169806	
hamlet@169807	HAMLET	What's his weapon?
hamlet@169833	
hamlet@169834	OSRIC	Rapier and dagger.
hamlet@169859	
hamlet@169860	HAMLET	That's two of his weapons: but, well.
hamlet@169905	
hamlet@169906	OSRIC	The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
hamlet@169961		horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
hamlet@170014		it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
hamlet@170063		assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
hamlet@170114		carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
hamlet@170165		responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
hamlet@170216		and of very liberal conceit.
hamlet@170246	
hamlet@170247	HAMLET	What call you the carriages?
hamlet@170283	
hamlet@170284	HORATIO	I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
hamlet@170352	
hamlet@170353	OSRIC	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
hamlet@170396	
hamlet@170397	HAMLET	The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
hamlet@170457		could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
hamlet@170508		be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
hamlet@170559		against six French swords, their assigns, and three
hamlet@170612		liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
hamlet@170664		against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
hamlet@170724	
hamlet@170725	OSRIC	The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
hamlet@170780		between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
hamlet@170831		three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
hamlet@170884		would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
hamlet@170933		would vouchsafe the answer.
hamlet@170962	
hamlet@170963	HAMLET	How if I answer 'no'?
hamlet@170992	
hamlet@170993	OSRIC	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
hamlet@171056	
hamlet@171057	HAMLET	Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
hamlet@171116		majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
hamlet@171170		the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
hamlet@171224		king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
hamlet@171277		if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
hamlet@171337	
hamlet@171338	OSRIC	Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
hamlet@171376	
hamlet@171377	HAMLET	To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
hamlet@171443	
hamlet@171444	OSRIC	I commend my duty to your lordship.
hamlet@171486	
hamlet@171487	HAMLET	Yours, yours.
hamlet@171508	
hamlet@171509		[Exit OSRIC]
hamlet@171523	
hamlet@171524		He does well to commend it himself; there are no
hamlet@171574		tongues else for's turn.
hamlet@171600	
hamlet@171601	HORATIO	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
hamlet@171660	
hamlet@171661	HAMLET	He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
hamlet@171717		Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
hamlet@171769		know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
hamlet@171821		the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
hamlet@171873		yesty collection, which carries them through and
hamlet@171923		through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
hamlet@171976		but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
hamlet@172028	
hamlet@172029		[Enter a Lord]
hamlet@172045	
hamlet@172046	Lord	My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
hamlet@172102		Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
hamlet@172156		the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
hamlet@172209		play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
hamlet@172264	
hamlet@172265	HAMLET	I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
hamlet@172324		pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
hamlet@172377		or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
hamlet@172423	
hamlet@172424	Lord	The king and queen and all are coming down.
hamlet@172473	
hamlet@172474	HAMLET	In happy time.
hamlet@172496	
hamlet@172497	Lord	The queen desires you to use some gentle
hamlet@172543		entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
hamlet@172594	
hamlet@172595	HAMLET	She well instructs me.
hamlet@172625	
hamlet@172626		[Exit Lord]
hamlet@172639	
hamlet@172640	HORATIO	You will lose this wager, my lord.
hamlet@172683	
hamlet@172684	HAMLET	I do not think so: since he went into France, I
hamlet@172739		have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
hamlet@172792		odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
hamlet@172845		about my heart: but it is no matter.
hamlet@172883	
hamlet@172884	HORATIO	Nay, good my lord,--
hamlet@172913	
hamlet@172914	HAMLET	It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
hamlet@172965		gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
hamlet@173013	
hamlet@173014	HORATIO	If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
hamlet@173070		forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
hamlet@173122		fit.
hamlet@173128	
hamlet@173129	HAMLET	Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
hamlet@173182		providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
hamlet@173234		'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
hamlet@173286		now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
hamlet@173332		readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
hamlet@173385		leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
hamlet@173422	
hamlet@173423		[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES,
hamlet@173471		Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &c]
hamlet@173517	
hamlet@173518	KING CLAUDIUS	Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
hamlet@173580	
hamlet@173581		[KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's]
hamlet@173631	
hamlet@173632	HAMLET	Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
hamlet@173686		But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
hamlet@173725		This presence knows,
hamlet@173747		And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
hamlet@173797		With sore distraction. What I have done,
hamlet@173839		That might your nature, honour and exception
hamlet@173885		Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
hamlet@173930		Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
hamlet@173975		If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
hamlet@174014		And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
hamlet@174061		Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
hamlet@174105		Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
hamlet@174150		Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
hamlet@174193		His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
hamlet@174230		Sir, in this audience,
hamlet@174254		Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
hamlet@174295		Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
hamlet@174343		That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
hamlet@174388		And hurt my brother.
hamlet@174410	
hamlet@174411	LAERTES	I am satisfied in nature,
hamlet@174445		Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
hamlet@174494		To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
hamlet@174536		I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
hamlet@174579		Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
hamlet@174625		I have a voice and precedent of peace,
hamlet@174665		To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
hamlet@174711		I do receive your offer'd love like love,
hamlet@174754		And will not wrong it.
hamlet@174778	
hamlet@174779	HAMLET	I embrace it freely;
hamlet@174807		And will this brother's wager frankly play.
hamlet@174852		Give us the foils. Come on.
hamlet@174881	
hamlet@174882	LAERTES	Come, one for me.
hamlet@174908	
hamlet@174909	HAMLET	I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
hamlet@174962		Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
hamlet@175015		Stick fiery off indeed.
hamlet@175040	
hamlet@175041	LAERTES	You mock me, sir.
hamlet@175067	
hamlet@175068	HAMLET	No, by this hand.
hamlet@175093	
hamlet@175094	KING CLAUDIUS	Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
hamlet@175157		You know the wager?
hamlet@175178	
hamlet@175179	HAMLET	Very well, my lord
hamlet@175205		Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
hamlet@175256	
hamlet@175257	KING CLAUDIUS	I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
hamlet@175311		But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
hamlet@175362	
hamlet@175363	LAERTES	This is too heavy, let me see another.
hamlet@175410	
hamlet@175411	HAMLET	This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
hamlet@175469	
hamlet@175470		[They prepare to play]
hamlet@175494	
hamlet@175495	OSRIC	Ay, my good lord.
hamlet@175519	
hamlet@175520	KING CLAUDIUS	Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
hamlet@175577		If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
hamlet@175618		Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
hamlet@175660		Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
hamlet@175706		The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
hamlet@175755		And in the cup an union shall he throw,
hamlet@175796		Richer than that which four successive kings
hamlet@175842		In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
hamlet@175891		And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
hamlet@175933		The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
hamlet@175972		The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
hamlet@176023		'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
hamlet@176069		And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
hamlet@176108	
hamlet@176109	HAMLET	Come on, sir.
hamlet@176130	
hamlet@176131	LAERTES	                  Come, my lord.
hamlet@176172	
hamlet@176173		[They play]
hamlet@176186	
hamlet@176187	HAMLET	One.
hamlet@176199	
hamlet@176200	LAERTES	No.
hamlet@176212	
hamlet@176213	HAMLET	Judgment.
hamlet@176230	
hamlet@176231	OSRIC	A hit, a very palpable hit.
hamlet@176265	
hamlet@176266	LAERTES	Well; again.
hamlet@176287	
hamlet@176288	KING CLAUDIUS	Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
hamlet@176352		Here's to thy health.
hamlet@176375	
hamlet@176376		[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within]
hamlet@176422	
hamlet@176423			Give him the cup.
hamlet@176443	
hamlet@176444	HAMLET	I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
hamlet@176502	
hamlet@176503		[They play]
hamlet@176516	
hamlet@176517		Another hit; what say you?
hamlet@176545

hamlet@176621	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  He's fat, and scant of breath.
hamlet@176685		Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
hamlet@176731		The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

hamlet@176776	HAMLET	Good madam!

hamlet@176901	KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.

hamlet@177126	LAERTES	[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
hamlet@177186	
hamlet@177187	HAMLET	Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
hamlet@177239		I pray you, pass with your best violence;
hamlet@177282		I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

hamlet@178332		Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,

hamlet@179166		Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
hamlet@179213		Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
hamlet@179261		But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
hamlet@179297		Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
hamlet@179341		To the unsatisfied.
hamlet@179362	
hamlet@179363	HORATIO	Never believe it:
hamlet@179389		I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
hamlet@179430		Here's yet some liquor left.
hamlet@179460	
hamlet@179461	HAMLET	As thou'rt a man,
hamlet@179486		Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
hamlet@179536		O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
hamlet@179574		Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
hamlet@179627		If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
hamlet@179668		Absent thee from felicity awhile,

hamlet@179753		To tell my story.
hamlet@179772

hamlet@179932		This warlike volley.
hamlet@179954	
hamlet@179955	HAMLET	O, I die, Horatio;
hamlet@179981		The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
hamlet@180028		I cannot live to hear the news from England;
hamlet@180074		But I do prophesy the election lights
hamlet@180113		On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
hamlet@180152		So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
hamlet@180202		Which have solicited. The rest is silence.

hamlet@180509	
hamlet@180510	HORATIO	What is it ye would see?
hamlet@180543		If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
hamlet@180590	
hamlet@180591	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
hamlet@180652		What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
hamlet@180697		That thou so many princes at a shot
hamlet@180734		So bloodily hast struck?
hamlet@180760	
hamlet@180761	First Ambassador	The sight is dismal;
hamlet@180799		And our affairs from England come too late:
hamlet@180844		The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
hamlet@180897		To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
hamlet@180940		That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
hamlet@180985		Where should we have our thanks?
hamlet@181019	
hamlet@181020	HORATIO	Not from his mouth,
hamlet@181048		Had it the ability of life to thank you:
hamlet@181090		He never gave commandment for their death.
hamlet@181134		But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
hamlet@181181		You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
hamlet@181230		Are here arrived give order that these bodies
hamlet@181277		High on a stage be placed to the view;
hamlet@181317		And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
hamlet@181362		How these things came about: so shall you hear
hamlet@181410		Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
hamlet@181450		Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
hamlet@181495		Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
hamlet@181542		And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
hamlet@181581		Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
hamlet@181629		Truly deliver.
hamlet@181645	
hamlet@181646	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	                  Let us haste to hear it,
hamlet@181707		And call the noblest to the audience.
hamlet@181746		For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
hamlet@181789		I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
hamlet@181836		Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
hamlet@181883	
hamlet@181884	HORATIO	Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
hamlet@181934		And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
hamlet@181985		But let this same be presently perform'd,
hamlet@182028		Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
hamlet@182082		On plots and errors, happen.
hamlet@182112	
hamlet@182113	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Let four captains
hamlet@182149		Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
hamlet@182193		For he was likely, had he been put on,
hamlet@182233		To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
hamlet@182285		The soldiers' music and the rites of war
hamlet@182327		Speak loudly for him.
hamlet@182350		Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
hamlet@182392		Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
hamlet@182439		Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

kingrichardiii@2440	
kingrichardiii@2441		[Enter GLOUCESTER, solus]
kingrichardiii@2468	
kingrichardiii@2469	GLOUCESTER	Now is the winter of our discontent
kingrichardiii@2516		Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
kingrichardiii@2559		And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
kingrichardiii@2606		In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
kingrichardiii@2646		Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
kingrichardiii@2696		Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
kingrichardiii@2737		Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
kingrichardiii@2783		Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
kingrichardiii@2829		Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
kingrichardiii@2881		And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
kingrichardiii@2925		To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
kingrichardiii@2970		He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
kingrichardiii@3008		To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
kingrichardiii@3047		But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
kingrichardiii@3095		Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
kingrichardiii@3140		I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
kingrichardiii@3192		To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
kingrichardiii@3233		I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
kingrichardiii@3280		Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
kingrichardiii@3323		Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
kingrichardiii@3366		Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
kingrichardiii@3415		And that so lamely and unfashionable
kingrichardiii@3453		That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
kingrichardiii@3494		Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
kingrichardiii@3538		Have no delight to pass away the time,
kingrichardiii@3578		Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
kingrichardiii@3614		And descant on mine own deformity:
kingrichardiii@3650		And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
kingrichardiii@3696		To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
kingrichardiii@3739		I am determined to prove a villain
kingrichardiii@3775		And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
kingrichardiii@3819		Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
kingrichardiii@3861		By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
kingrichardiii@3904		To set my brother Clarence and the king
kingrichardiii@3945		In deadly hate the one against the other:
kingrichardiii@3988		And if King Edward be as true and just
kingrichardiii@4028		As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
kingrichardiii@4068		This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
kingrichardiii@4115		About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
kingrichardiii@4154		Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
kingrichardiii@4196		Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
kingrichardiii@4235		Clarence comes.

kingrichardiii@4345		That waits upon your grace?
kingrichardiii@4374	
kingrichardiii@4375	CLARENCE	His majesty
kingrichardiii@4396		Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
kingrichardiii@4442		This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
kingrichardiii@4483	
kingrichardiii@4484	GLOUCESTER	Upon what cause?
kingrichardiii@4512	
kingrichardiii@4513	CLARENCE	                  Because my name is George.
kingrichardiii@4567	
kingrichardiii@4568	GLOUCESTER	Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
kingrichardiii@4624		He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
kingrichardiii@4670		O, belike his majesty hath some intent
kingrichardiii@4710		That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
kingrichardiii@4758		But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
kingrichardiii@4805	
kingrichardiii@4806	CLARENCE	Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
kingrichardiii@4856		As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
kingrichardiii@4895		He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
kingrichardiii@4937		And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
kingrichardiii@4982		And says a wizard told him that by G
kingrichardiii@5020		His issue disinherited should be;
kingrichardiii@5055		And, for my name of George begins with G,
kingrichardiii@5098		It follows in his thought that I am he.
kingrichardiii@5139		These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
kingrichardiii@5187		Have moved his highness to commit me now.
kingrichardiii@5230	
kingrichardiii@5231	GLOUCESTER	Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
kingrichardiii@5288		'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
kingrichardiii@5336		My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
kingrichardiii@5379		That tempers him to this extremity.
kingrichardiii@5416		Was it not she and that good man of worship,
kingrichardiii@5462		Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
kingrichardiii@5501		That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
kingrichardiii@5549		From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
kingrichardiii@5596		We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

kingrichardiii@5642	CLARENCE	By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
kingrichardiii@5695		But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
kingrichardiii@5746		That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
kingrichardiii@5796		Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
kingrichardiii@5835		Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
kingrichardiii@5879	
kingrichardiii@5880	GLOUCESTER	Humbly complaining to her deity
kingrichardiii@5923		Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
kingrichardiii@5961		I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
kingrichardiii@6005		If we will keep in favour with the king,
kingrichardiii@6047		To be her men and wear her livery:
kingrichardiii@6083		The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
kingrichardiii@6124		Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
kingrichardiii@6173		Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
kingrichardiii@6211	
kingrichardiii@6212	BRAKENBURY	I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
kingrichardiii@6264		His majesty hath straitly given in charge
kingrichardiii@6307		That no man shall have private conference,
kingrichardiii@6351		Of what degree soever, with his brother.
kingrichardiii@6393	
kingrichardiii@6394	GLOUCESTER	Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
kingrichardiii@6452		You may partake of any thing we say:
kingrichardiii@6490		We speak no treason, man: we say the king
kingrichardiii@6533		Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
kingrichardiii@6576		Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
kingrichardiii@6622		We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
kingrichardiii@6668		A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
kingrichardiii@6723		And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
kingrichardiii@6776		How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
kingrichardiii@6817	
kingrichardiii@6818	BRAKENBURY	With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
kingrichardiii@6875	
kingrichardiii@6876	GLOUCESTER	Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
kingrichardiii@6942		He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
kingrichardiii@6988		Were best he do it secretly, alone.
kingrichardiii@7025	
kingrichardiii@7026	BRAKENBURY	What one, my lord?
kingrichardiii@7056	
kingrichardiii@7057	GLOUCESTER	Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
kingrichardiii@7112	
kingrichardiii@7113	BRAKENBURY	I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
kingrichardiii@7170		Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
kingrichardiii@7216	
kingrichardiii@7217	CLARENCE	We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
kingrichardiii@7273	
kingrichardiii@7274	GLOUCESTER	We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
kingrichardiii@7328		Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
kingrichardiii@7370		And whatsoever you will employ me in,
kingrichardiii@7409		Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
kingrichardiii@7454		I will perform it to enfranchise you.
kingrichardiii@7493		Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
kingrichardiii@7538		Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
kingrichardiii@7579	
kingrichardiii@7580	CLARENCE	I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
kingrichardiii@7628	
kingrichardiii@7629	GLOUCESTER	Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
kingrichardiii@7683		Meantime, have patience.
kingrichardiii@7709	
kingrichardiii@7710	CLARENCE	I must perforce. Farewell.
kingrichardiii@7746	
kingrichardiii@7747		[Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard]
kingrichardiii@7789	
kingrichardiii@7790	GLOUCESTER	Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
kingrichardiii@7850		Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
kingrichardiii@7894		That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
kingrichardiii@7940		If heaven will take the present at our hands.
kingrichardiii@7987		But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
kingrichardiii@8036	
kingrichardiii@8037		[Enter HASTINGS]
kingrichardiii@8055	
kingrichardiii@8056	HASTINGS	Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
kingrichardiii@8105	
kingrichardiii@8106	GLOUCESTER	As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
kingrichardiii@8156		Well are you welcome to the open air.
kingrichardiii@8195		How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
kingrichardiii@8241	
kingrichardiii@8242	HASTINGS	With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
kingrichardiii@8297		But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
kingrichardiii@8345		That were the cause of my imprisonment.
kingrichardiii@8386	
kingrichardiii@8387	GLOUCESTER	No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
kingrichardiii@8445		For they that were your enemies are his,
kingrichardiii@8487		And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
kingrichardiii@8530	
kingrichardiii@8531	HASTINGS	More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
kingrichardiii@8582		While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
kingrichardiii@8625	
kingrichardiii@8626	GLOUCESTER	What news abroad?
kingrichardiii@8655	
kingrichardiii@8656	HASTINGS	No news so bad abroad as this at home;
kingrichardiii@8704		The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
kingrichardiii@8746		And his physicians fear him mightily.
kingrichardiii@8785	
kingrichardiii@8786	GLOUCESTER	Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
kingrichardiii@8842		O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
kingrichardiii@8878		And overmuch consumed his royal person:
kingrichardiii@8919		'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
kingrichardiii@8959		What, is he in his bed?
kingrichardiii@8984	
kingrichardiii@8985	HASTINGS	He is.
kingrichardiii@9001	
kingrichardiii@9002	GLOUCESTER	Go you before, and I will follow you.
kingrichardiii@9051	
kingrichardiii@9052		[Exit HASTINGS]
kingrichardiii@9069	
kingrichardiii@9070		He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
kingrichardiii@9112		Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
kingrichardiii@9165		I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
kingrichardiii@9212		With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
kingrichardiii@9260		And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
kingrichardiii@9299		Clarence hath not another day to live:
kingrichardiii@9339		Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
kingrichardiii@9387		And leave the world for me to bustle in!
kingrichardiii@9429		For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
kingrichardiii@9479		What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
kingrichardiii@9529		The readiest way to make the wench amends
kingrichardiii@9572		Is to become her husband and her father:
kingrichardiii@9614		The which will I; not all so much for love
kingrichardiii@9658		As for another secret close intent,
kingrichardiii@9695		By marrying her which I must reach unto.
kingrichardiii@9737		But yet I run before my horse to market:
kingrichardiii@9779		Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
kingrichardiii@9836		When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

kingrichardiii@9927	SCENE II	The same. Another street.
kingrichardiii@9962	
kingrichardiii@9963		[Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen
kingrichardiii@10017		with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner]
kingrichardiii@10074	
kingrichardiii@10075	LADY ANNE	Set down, set down your honourable load,
kingrichardiii@10126		If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
kingrichardiii@10166		Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
kingrichardiii@10203		The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
kingrichardiii@10245		Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
kingrichardiii@10283		Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
kingrichardiii@10322		Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
kingrichardiii@10367		Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
kingrichardiii@10408		To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
kingrichardiii@10448		Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
kingrichardiii@10493		Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
kingrichardiii@10547		Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
kingrichardiii@10594		I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
kingrichardiii@10637		Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
kingrichardiii@10686		Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
kingrichardiii@10736		Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
kingrichardiii@10786		More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
kingrichardiii@10830		That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
kingrichardiii@10876		Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
kingrichardiii@10920		Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
kingrichardiii@10963		If ever he have child, abortive be it,
kingrichardiii@11003		Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
kingrichardiii@11047		Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
kingrichardiii@11080		May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
kingrichardiii@11124		And that be heir to his unhappiness!
kingrichardiii@11162		If ever he have wife, let her he made
kingrichardiii@11201		A miserable by the death of him
kingrichardiii@11234		As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
kingrichardiii@11274		Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
kingrichardiii@11323		Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
kingrichardiii@11364		And still, as you are weary of the weight,
kingrichardiii@11408		Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.

kingrichardiii@11456		[Enter GLOUCESTER]
kingrichardiii@11476	
kingrichardiii@11477	GLOUCESTER	Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
kingrichardiii@11536	
kingrichardiii@11537	LADY ANNE	What black magician conjures up this fiend,
kingrichardiii@11591		To stop devoted charitable deeds?
kingrichardiii@11626	
kingrichardiii@11627	GLOUCESTER	Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
kingrichardiii@11687		I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
kingrichardiii@11728	
kingrichardiii@11729	Gentleman	My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
kingrichardiii@11785	
kingrichardiii@11786	GLOUCESTER	Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
kingrichardiii@11841		Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
kingrichardiii@11885		Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
kingrichardiii@11934		And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
kingrichardiii@11982	
kingrichardiii@11983	LADY ANNE	What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
kingrichardiii@12035		Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
kingrichardiii@12079		And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
kingrichardiii@12121		Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
kingrichardiii@12162		Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
kingrichardiii@12206		His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
kingrichardiii@12256	
kingrichardiii@12257	GLOUCESTER	Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
kingrichardiii@12311	
kingrichardiii@12312	LADY ANNE	Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
kingrichardiii@12377		For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
kingrichardiii@12423		Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
kingrichardiii@12472		If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
kingrichardiii@12516		Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
kingrichardiii@12556		O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
kingrichardiii@12601		Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
kingrichardiii@12648		Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
kingrichardiii@12692		For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
kingrichardiii@12739		From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
kingrichardiii@12790		Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
kingrichardiii@12824		Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
kingrichardiii@12862		O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
kingrichardiii@12914		O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
kingrichardiii@12969		Either heaven with lightning strike the
kingrichardiii@13010		murderer dead,
kingrichardiii@13026		Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
kingrichardiii@13071		As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
kingrichardiii@13119		Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
kingrichardiii@13164	
kingrichardiii@13165	GLOUCESTER	Lady, you know no rules of charity,
kingrichardiii@13212		Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
kingrichardiii@13263	
kingrichardiii@13264	LADY ANNE	Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
kingrichardiii@13319		No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
kingrichardiii@13369	
kingrichardiii@13370	GLOUCESTER	But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
kingrichardiii@13425	
kingrichardiii@13426	LADY ANNE	O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
kingrichardiii@13477	
kingrichardiii@13478	GLOUCESTER	More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
kingrichardiii@13531		Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
kingrichardiii@13573		Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
kingrichardiii@13617		By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
kingrichardiii@13657	
kingrichardiii@13658	LADY ANNE	Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
kingrichardiii@13707		For these known evils, but to give me leave,
kingrichardiii@13753		By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
kingrichardiii@13797	
kingrichardiii@13798	GLOUCESTER	Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
kingrichardiii@13855		Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
kingrichardiii@13895	
kingrichardiii@13896	LADY ANNE	Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
kingrichardiii@13956		No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
kingrichardiii@13997	
kingrichardiii@13998	GLOUCESTER	By such despair, I should accuse myself.
kingrichardiii@14050	
kingrichardiii@14051	LADY ANNE	And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
kingrichardiii@14110		For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
kingrichardiii@14150		Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
kingrichardiii@14195	
kingrichardiii@14196	GLOUCESTER	Say that I slew them not?
kingrichardiii@14233	
kingrichardiii@14234	LADY ANNE	Why, then they are not dead:
kingrichardiii@14273		But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
kingrichardiii@14322	
kingrichardiii@14323	GLOUCESTER	I did not kill your husband.
kingrichardiii@14363	
kingrichardiii@14364	LADY ANNE	Why, then he is alive.
kingrichardiii@14397	
kingrichardiii@14398	GLOUCESTER	Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
kingrichardiii@14454	
kingrichardiii@14455	LADY ANNE	In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
kingrichardiii@14515		Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
kingrichardiii@14561		The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
kingrichardiii@14613		But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
kingrichardiii@14658	
kingrichardiii@14659	GLOUCESTER	I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
kingrichardiii@14711		which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
kingrichardiii@14764	
kingrichardiii@14765	LADY ANNE	Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
kingrichardiii@14814		Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
kingrichardiii@14859		Didst thou not kill this king?
kingrichardiii@14891	
kingrichardiii@14892	GLOUCESTER	I grant ye.
kingrichardiii@14915	
kingrichardiii@14916	LADY ANNE	Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
kingrichardiii@14974		Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
kingrichardiii@15018		O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
kingrichardiii@15057	
kingrichardiii@15058	GLOUCESTER	The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
kingrichardiii@15119	
kingrichardiii@15120	LADY ANNE	He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
kingrichardiii@15176	
kingrichardiii@15177	GLOUCESTER	Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
kingrichardiii@15237		For he was fitter for that place than earth.
kingrichardiii@15283	
kingrichardiii@15284	LADY ANNE	And thou unfit for any place but hell.
kingrichardiii@15333	
kingrichardiii@15334	GLOUCESTER	Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
kingrichardiii@15395	
kingrichardiii@15396	LADY ANNE	Some dungeon.
kingrichardiii@15420	
kingrichardiii@15421	GLOUCESTER	                             Your bed-chamber.
kingrichardiii@15479	
kingrichardiii@15480	LADY ANNE	I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
kingrichardiii@15537	
kingrichardiii@15538	GLOUCESTER	So will it, madam till I lie with you.
kingrichardiii@15588	
kingrichardiii@15589	LADY ANNE	I hope so.
kingrichardiii@15610	
kingrichardiii@15611	GLOUCESTER	I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
kingrichardiii@15656		To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
kingrichardiii@15699		And fall somewhat into a slower method,
kingrichardiii@15740		Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
kingrichardiii@15782		Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
kingrichardiii@15824		As blameful as the executioner?
kingrichardiii@15857	
kingrichardiii@15858	LADY ANNE	Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
kingrichardiii@15914	
kingrichardiii@15915	GLOUCESTER	Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
kingrichardiii@15968		Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
kingrichardiii@16013		To undertake the death of all the world,
kingrichardiii@16055		So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
kingrichardiii@16102	
kingrichardiii@16103	LADY ANNE	If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
kingrichardiii@16155		These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
kingrichardiii@16208	
kingrichardiii@16209	GLOUCESTER	These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
kingrichardiii@16272		You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
kingrichardiii@16315		As all the world is cheered by the sun,
kingrichardiii@16356		So I by that; it is my day, my life.
kingrichardiii@16394	
kingrichardiii@16395	LADY ANNE	Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
kingrichardiii@16456	
kingrichardiii@16457	GLOUCESTER	Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
kingrichardiii@16516	
kingrichardiii@16517	LADY ANNE	I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
kingrichardiii@16567	
kingrichardiii@16568	GLOUCESTER	It is a quarrel most unnatural,
kingrichardiii@16611		To be revenged on him that loveth you.
kingrichardiii@16651	
kingrichardiii@16652	LADY ANNE	It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
kingrichardiii@16699		To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
kingrichardiii@16744	
kingrichardiii@16745	GLOUCESTER	He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
kingrichardiii@16799		Did it to help thee to a better husband.
kingrichardiii@16841	
kingrichardiii@16842	LADY ANNE	His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
kingrichardiii@16896	
kingrichardiii@16897	GLOUCESTER	He lives that loves thee better than he could.
kingrichardiii@16955	
kingrichardiii@16956	LADY ANNE	Name him.
kingrichardiii@16976	
kingrichardiii@16977	GLOUCESTER	        Plantagenet.
kingrichardiii@17009	
kingrichardiii@17010	LADY ANNE	Why, that was he.
kingrichardiii@17038	
kingrichardiii@17039	GLOUCESTER	The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
kingrichardiii@17095	
kingrichardiii@17096	LADY ANNE	Where is he?
kingrichardiii@17119	
kingrichardiii@17120	GLOUCESTER	                 Here.
kingrichardiii@17154	
kingrichardiii@17155		[She spitteth at him]
kingrichardiii@17178	
kingrichardiii@17179		Why dost thou spit at me?
kingrichardiii@17206	
kingrichardiii@17207	LADY ANNE	Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
kingrichardiii@17260	
kingrichardiii@17261	GLOUCESTER	Never came poison from so sweet a place.
kingrichardiii@17313	
kingrichardiii@17314	LADY ANNE	Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
kingrichardiii@17360		Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
kingrichardiii@17404	
kingrichardiii@17405	GLOUCESTER	Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
kingrichardiii@17460	
kingrichardiii@17461	LADY ANNE	Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
kingrichardiii@17519	
kingrichardiii@17520	GLOUCESTER	I would they were, that I might die at once;
kingrichardiii@17576		For now they kill me with a living death.
kingrichardiii@17619		Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
kingrichardiii@17673		Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
kingrichardiii@17724		These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
kingrichardiii@17769		No, when my father York and Edward wept,
kingrichardiii@17811		To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
kingrichardiii@17855		When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
kingrichardiii@17906		Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
kingrichardiii@17950		Told the sad story of my father's death,
kingrichardiii@17992		And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
kingrichardiii@18038		That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
kingrichardiii@18085		Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
kingrichardiii@18134		My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
kingrichardiii@18175		And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
kingrichardiii@18224		Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
kingrichardiii@18276		I never sued to friend nor enemy;
kingrichardiii@18311		My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
kingrichardiii@18362		But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
kingrichardiii@18402		My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
kingrichardiii@18456	
kingrichardiii@18457		[She looks scornfully at him]
kingrichardiii@18488	
kingrichardiii@18489		Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
kingrichardiii@18540		For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
kingrichardiii@18583		If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
kingrichardiii@18624		Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
kingrichardiii@18672		Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
kingrichardiii@18722		And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
kingrichardiii@18765		I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
kingrichardiii@18803		And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
kingrichardiii@18843	
kingrichardiii@18844		[He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword]
kingrichardiii@18904	
kingrichardiii@18905		Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
kingrichardiii@18952		But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
kingrichardiii@18992		Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
kingrichardiii@19047		But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
kingrichardiii@19092	
kingrichardiii@19093		[Here she lets fall the sword]
kingrichardiii@19125	
kingrichardiii@19126		Take up the sword again, or take up me.
kingrichardiii@19167	
kingrichardiii@19168	LADY ANNE	Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
kingrichardiii@19222		I will not be the executioner.
kingrichardiii@19254	
kingrichardiii@19255	GLOUCESTER	Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
kingrichardiii@19309	
kingrichardiii@19310	LADY ANNE	I have already.
kingrichardiii@19336	
kingrichardiii@19337	GLOUCESTER	                  Tush, that was in thy rage:
kingrichardiii@19394		Speak it again, and, even with the word,
kingrichardiii@19436		That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
kingrichardiii@19488		Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
kingrichardiii@19533		To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
kingrichardiii@19580	
kingrichardiii@19581	LADY ANNE	I would I knew thy heart.
kingrichardiii@19617	
kingrichardiii@19618	GLOUCESTER	'Tis figured in my tongue.
kingrichardiii@19656	
kingrichardiii@19657	LADY ANNE	I fear me both are false.
kingrichardiii@19693	
kingrichardiii@19694	GLOUCESTER	Then never man was true.
kingrichardiii@19730	
kingrichardiii@19731	LADY ANNE	Well, well, put up your sword.
kingrichardiii@19772	
kingrichardiii@19773	GLOUCESTER	Say, then, my peace is made.
kingrichardiii@19813	
kingrichardiii@19814	LADY ANNE	That shall you know hereafter.
kingrichardiii@19855	
kingrichardiii@19856	GLOUCESTER	But shall I live in hope?
kingrichardiii@19893	
kingrichardiii@19894	LADY ANNE	All men, I hope, live so.
kingrichardiii@19930	
kingrichardiii@19931	GLOUCESTER	Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
kingrichardiii@19971	
kingrichardiii@19972	LADY ANNE	To take is not to give.
kingrichardiii@20006	
kingrichardiii@20007	GLOUCESTER	Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
kingrichardiii@20059		Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
kingrichardiii@20104		Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
kingrichardiii@20152		And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
kingrichardiii@20191		But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
kingrichardiii@20233		Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
kingrichardiii@20276	
kingrichardiii@20277	LADY ANNE	What is it?
kingrichardiii@20299	
kingrichardiii@20300	GLOUCESTER	That it would please thee leave these sad designs
kingrichardiii@20361		To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
kingrichardiii@20407		And presently repair to Crosby Place;
kingrichardiii@20446		Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
kingrichardiii@20485		At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
kingrichardiii@20525		And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
kingrichardiii@20569		I will with all expedient duty see you:
kingrichardiii@20610		For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
kingrichardiii@20654		Grant me this boon.
kingrichardiii@20675	
kingrichardiii@20676	LADY ANNE	With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
kingrichardiii@20730		To see you are become so penitent.
kingrichardiii@20766		Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
kingrichardiii@20807	
kingrichardiii@20808	GLOUCESTER	Bid me farewell.
kingrichardiii@20836	
kingrichardiii@20837	LADY ANNE	'Tis more than you deserve;
kingrichardiii@20875		But since you teach me how to flatter you,
kingrichardiii@20919		Imagine I have said farewell already.
kingrichardiii@20958	
kingrichardiii@20959		[Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY]
kingrichardiii@21002	
kingrichardiii@21003	GLOUCESTER	Sirs, take up the corse.
kingrichardiii@21039	
kingrichardiii@21040	GENTLEMEN	Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
kingrichardiii@21080	
kingrichardiii@21081	GLOUCESTER	No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
kingrichardiii@21138	
kingrichardiii@21139		[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
kingrichardiii@21168	
kingrichardiii@21169		Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
kingrichardiii@21207		Was ever woman in this humour won?
kingrichardiii@21243		I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
kingrichardiii@21289		What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
kingrichardiii@21339		To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
kingrichardiii@21383		With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
kingrichardiii@21429		The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
kingrichardiii@21469		Having God, her conscience, and these bars
kingrichardiii@21513		against me,
kingrichardiii@21526		And I nothing to back my suit at all,
kingrichardiii@21565		But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
kingrichardiii@21609		And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
kingrichardiii@21656		Ha!
kingrichardiii@21661		Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
kingrichardiii@21705		Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
kingrichardiii@21757		Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
kingrichardiii@21797		A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
kingrichardiii@21834		Framed in the prodigality of nature,
kingrichardiii@21872		Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
kingrichardiii@21923		The spacious world cannot again afford
kingrichardiii@21963		And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
kingrichardiii@22004		That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
kingrichardiii@22057		And made her widow to a woful bed?
kingrichardiii@22093		On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
kingrichardiii@22139		On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
kingrichardiii@22179		My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
kingrichardiii@22213		I do mistake my person all this while:
kingrichardiii@22253		Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
kingrichardiii@22298		Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
kingrichardiii@22337		I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
kingrichardiii@22378		And entertain some score or two of tailors,
kingrichardiii@22423		To study fashions to adorn my body:
kingrichardiii@22460		Since I am crept in favour with myself,
kingrichardiii@22501		Will maintain it with some little cost.
kingrichardiii@22542		But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
kingrichardiii@22588		And then return lamenting to my love.
kingrichardiii@22627		Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
kingrichardiii@22677		That I may see my shadow as I pass.

kingrichardiii@22745	
kingrichardiii@22746	
kingrichardiii@22747	ACT I
kingrichardiii@22753	
kingrichardiii@22754	
kingrichardiii@22755	
kingrichardiii@22756	SCENE III	The palace.
kingrichardiii@22778	
kingrichardiii@22779	
kingrichardiii@22780		[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY]
kingrichardiii@22823	
kingrichardiii@22824	RIVERS	Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
kingrichardiii@22882		Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
kingrichardiii@22924	
kingrichardiii@22925	GREY	In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
kingrichardiii@22975		Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
kingrichardiii@23027		And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
kingrichardiii@23076	
kingrichardiii@23077	QUEEN ELIZABETH	If he were dead, what would betide of me?
kingrichardiii@23135	
kingrichardiii@23136	RIVERS	No other harm but loss of such a lord.
kingrichardiii@23182	
kingrichardiii@23183	QUEEN ELIZABETH	The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
kingrichardiii@23242	
kingrichardiii@23243	GREY	The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
kingrichardiii@23296		To be your comforter when he is gone.
kingrichardiii@23335	
kingrichardiii@23336	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Oh, he is young and his minority
kingrichardiii@23385		Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
kingrichardiii@23431		A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
kingrichardiii@23474	
kingrichardiii@23475	RIVERS	Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
kingrichardiii@23526	
kingrichardiii@23527	QUEEN ELIZABETH	It is determined, not concluded yet:
kingrichardiii@23580		But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
kingrichardiii@23622	
kingrichardiii@23623		[Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY]
kingrichardiii@23653	
kingrichardiii@23654	GREY	Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
kingrichardiii@23704	
kingrichardiii@23705	BUCKINGHAM	Good time of day unto your royal grace!
kingrichardiii@23756	
kingrichardiii@23757	DERBY	God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
kingrichardiii@23810	
kingrichardiii@23811	QUEEN ELIZABETH	The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
kingrichardiii@23873		To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
kingrichardiii@23919		Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
kingrichardiii@23965		And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
kingrichardiii@24011		I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
kingrichardiii@24052	
kingrichardiii@24053	DERBY	I do beseech you, either not believe
kingrichardiii@24096		The envious slanders of her false accusers;
kingrichardiii@24141		Or, if she be accused in true report,
kingrichardiii@24180		Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
kingrichardiii@24229		From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
kingrichardiii@24277	
kingrichardiii@24278	RIVERS	Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
kingrichardiii@24328	
kingrichardiii@24329	DERBY	But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
kingrichardiii@24372		Are come from visiting his majesty.
kingrichardiii@24409	
kingrichardiii@24410	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
kingrichardiii@24467	
kingrichardiii@24468	BUCKINGHAM	Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
kingrichardiii@24526	
kingrichardiii@24527	QUEEN ELIZABETH	God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
kingrichardiii@24590	
kingrichardiii@24591	BUCKINGHAM	Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
kingrichardiii@24646		Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
kingrichardiii@24697		And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
kingrichardiii@24740		And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
kingrichardiii@24786	
kingrichardiii@24787	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Would all were well! but that will never be
kingrichardiii@24847		I fear our happiness is at the highest.
kingrichardiii@24888	
kingrichardiii@24889		[Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET]
kingrichardiii@24931	
kingrichardiii@24932	GLOUCESTER	They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
kingrichardiii@24987		Who are they that complain unto the king,
kingrichardiii@25030		That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
kingrichardiii@25078		By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
kingrichardiii@25125		That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
kingrichardiii@25176		Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
kingrichardiii@25218		Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
kingrichardiii@25266		Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
kingrichardiii@25309		I must be held a rancorous enemy.
kingrichardiii@25344		Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
kingrichardiii@25388		But thus his simple truth must be abused
kingrichardiii@25430		By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
kingrichardiii@25466	
kingrichardiii@25467	RIVERS	To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
kingrichardiii@25522	
kingrichardiii@25523	GLOUCESTER	To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
kingrichardiii@25576		When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
kingrichardiii@25625		Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
kingrichardiii@25668		A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
kingrichardiii@25712		Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
kingrichardiii@25761		Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
kingrichardiii@25804		But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
kingrichardiii@25852	
kingrichardiii@25853	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
kingrichardiii@25916		The king, of his own royal disposition,
kingrichardiii@25957		And not provoked by any suitor else;
kingrichardiii@25995		Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
kingrichardiii@26037		Which in your outward actions shows itself
kingrichardiii@26081		Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
kingrichardiii@26124		Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
kingrichardiii@26171		The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
kingrichardiii@26219	
kingrichardiii@26220	GLOUCESTER	I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
kingrichardiii@26273		That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
kingrichardiii@26324		Since every Jack became a gentleman
kingrichardiii@26361		There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
kingrichardiii@26404	
kingrichardiii@26405	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
kingrichardiii@26463		Gloucester;
kingrichardiii@26476		You envy my advancement and my friends':
kingrichardiii@26518		God grant we never may have need of you!
kingrichardiii@26560	
kingrichardiii@26561	GLOUCESTER	Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
kingrichardiii@26619		Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
kingrichardiii@26662		Myself disgraced, and the nobility
kingrichardiii@26698		Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
kingrichardiii@26745		Are daily given to ennoble those
kingrichardiii@26779		That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
kingrichardiii@26834	
kingrichardiii@26835	QUEEN ELIZABETH	By Him that raised me to this careful height
kingrichardiii@26896		From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
kingrichardiii@26938		I never did incense his majesty
kingrichardiii@26971		Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
kingrichardiii@27016		An earnest advocate to plead for him.
kingrichardiii@27055		My lord, you do me shameful injury,
kingrichardiii@27092		Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
kingrichardiii@27136	
kingrichardiii@27137	GLOUCESTER	You may deny that you were not the cause
kingrichardiii@27189		Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
kingrichardiii@27230	
kingrichardiii@27231	RIVERS	She may, my lord, for--
kingrichardiii@27262	
kingrichardiii@27263	GLOUCESTER	She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
kingrichardiii@27319		She may do more, sir, than denying that:
kingrichardiii@27361		She may help you to many fair preferments,
kingrichardiii@27405		And then deny her aiding hand therein,
kingrichardiii@27445		And lay those honours on your high deserts.
kingrichardiii@27490		What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
kingrichardiii@27540	
kingrichardiii@27541	RIVERS	What, marry, may she?
kingrichardiii@27570	
kingrichardiii@27571	GLOUCESTER	What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
kingrichardiii@27623		A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
kingrichardiii@27662		I wis your grandam had a worser match.
kingrichardiii@27702	
kingrichardiii@27703	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
kingrichardiii@27764		Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
kingrichardiii@27812		By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
kingrichardiii@27852		With those gross taunts I often have endured.
kingrichardiii@27899		I had rather be a country servant-maid
kingrichardiii@27939		Than a great queen, with this condition,
kingrichardiii@27981		To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
kingrichardiii@28026	
kingrichardiii@28027		[Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind]
kingrichardiii@28059	
kingrichardiii@28060		Small joy have I in being England's queen.
kingrichardiii@28104	
kingrichardiii@28105	QUEEN MARGARET	And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
kingrichardiii@28169		Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
kingrichardiii@28211	
kingrichardiii@28212	GLOUCESTER	What! threat you me with telling of the king?
kingrichardiii@28269		Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
kingrichardiii@28318		I will avouch in presence of the king:
kingrichardiii@28358		I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
kingrichardiii@28401		'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
kingrichardiii@28449	
kingrichardiii@28450	QUEEN MARGARET	Out, devil! I remember them too well:
kingrichardiii@28503		Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
kingrichardiii@28548		And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
kingrichardiii@28588	
kingrichardiii@28589	GLOUCESTER	Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
kingrichardiii@28647		I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
kingrichardiii@28689		A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
kingrichardiii@28729		A liberal rewarder of his friends:
kingrichardiii@28765		To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
kingrichardiii@28806	
kingrichardiii@28807	QUEEN MARGARET	Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
kingrichardiii@28868	
kingrichardiii@28869	GLOUCESTER	In all which time you and your husband Grey
kingrichardiii@28924		Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
kingrichardiii@28967		And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
kingrichardiii@29015		In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
kingrichardiii@29061		Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
kingrichardiii@29103		What you have been ere now, and what you are;
kingrichardiii@29150		Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
kingrichardiii@29192	
kingrichardiii@29193	QUEEN MARGARET	A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
kingrichardiii@29252	
kingrichardiii@29253	GLOUCESTER	Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
kingrichardiii@29311		Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
kingrichardiii@29361	
kingrichardiii@29362	QUEEN MARGARET	Which God revenge!
kingrichardiii@29396	
kingrichardiii@29397	GLOUCESTER	To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
kingrichardiii@29450		And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
kingrichardiii@29496		I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
kingrichardiii@29548		Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
kingrichardiii@29589		I am too childish-foolish for this world.
kingrichardiii@29632	
kingrichardiii@29633	QUEEN MARGARET	Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
kingrichardiii@29697		Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
kingrichardiii@29736	
kingrichardiii@29737	RIVERS	My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
kingrichardiii@29786		Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
kingrichardiii@29828		We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
kingrichardiii@29873		So should we you, if you should be our king.
kingrichardiii@29919	
kingrichardiii@29920	GLOUCESTER	If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
kingrichardiii@29973		Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
kingrichardiii@30018	
kingrichardiii@30019	QUEEN ELIZABETH	As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
kingrichardiii@30074		You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
kingrichardiii@30123		As little joy may you suppose in me.
kingrichardiii@30161		That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
kingrichardiii@30201	
kingrichardiii@30202	QUEEN MARGARET	A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
kingrichardiii@30256		For I am she, and altogether joyless.
kingrichardiii@30295		I can no longer hold me patient.
kingrichardiii@30329	
kingrichardiii@30330		[Advancing]
kingrichardiii@30343	
kingrichardiii@30344		Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
kingrichardiii@30391		In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
kingrichardiii@30439		Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
kingrichardiii@30484		If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
kingrichardiii@30537		Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
kingrichardiii@30587		O gentle villain, do not turn away!
kingrichardiii@30624	
kingrichardiii@30625	GLOUCESTER	Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
kingrichardiii@30687	
kingrichardiii@30688	QUEEN MARGARET	But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
kingrichardiii@30744		That will I make before I let thee go.
kingrichardiii@30784	
kingrichardiii@30785	GLOUCESTER	Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
kingrichardiii@30837	
kingrichardiii@30838	QUEEN MARGARET	I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
kingrichardiii@30898		Than death can yield me here by my abode.
kingrichardiii@30941		A husband and a son thou owest to me;
kingrichardiii@30980		And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
kingrichardiii@31024		The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
kingrichardiii@31068		And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
kingrichardiii@31111	
kingrichardiii@31112	GLOUCESTER	The curse my noble father laid on thee,
kingrichardiii@31163		When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
kingrichardiii@31215		And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
kingrichardiii@31266		And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
kingrichardiii@31314		Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
kingrichardiii@31366		His curses, then from bitterness of soul
kingrichardiii@31408		Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
kingrichardiii@31459		And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
kingrichardiii@31507	
kingrichardiii@31508	QUEEN ELIZABETH	So just is God, to right the innocent.
kingrichardiii@31563	
kingrichardiii@31564	HASTINGS	O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
kingrichardiii@31618		And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
kingrichardiii@31666	
kingrichardiii@31667	RIVERS	Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
kingrichardiii@31720	
kingrichardiii@31721	DORSET	No man but prophesied revenge for it.
kingrichardiii@31766	
kingrichardiii@31767	BUCKINGHAM	Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
kingrichardiii@31824	
kingrichardiii@31825	QUEEN MARGARET	What were you snarling all before I came,
kingrichardiii@31882		Ready to catch each other by the throat,
kingrichardiii@31924		And turn you all your hatred now on me?
kingrichardiii@31965		Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
kingrichardiii@32018		That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
kingrichardiii@32065		Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
kingrichardiii@32109		Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
kingrichardiii@32154		Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
kingrichardiii@32202		Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
kingrichardiii@32257		If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
kingrichardiii@32299		As ours by murder, to make him a king!
kingrichardiii@32339		Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
kingrichardiii@32386		For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
kingrichardiii@32433		Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
kingrichardiii@32478		Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
kingrichardiii@32521		Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
kingrichardiii@32564		Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
kingrichardiii@32615		And see another, as I see thee now,
kingrichardiii@32652		Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
kingrichardiii@32704		Long die thy happy days before thy death;
kingrichardiii@32747		And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
kingrichardiii@32791		Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
kingrichardiii@32839		Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
kingrichardiii@32881		And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
kingrichardiii@32927		Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
kingrichardiii@32978		That none of you may live your natural age,
kingrichardiii@33023		But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
kingrichardiii@33063	
kingrichardiii@33064	GLOUCESTER	Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
kingrichardiii@33123	
kingrichardiii@33124	QUEEN MARGARET	And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
kingrichardiii@33194		If heaven have any grievous plague in store
kingrichardiii@33239		Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
kingrichardiii@33283		O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
kingrichardiii@33327		And then hurl down their indignation
kingrichardiii@33365		On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
kingrichardiii@33415		The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
kingrichardiii@33462		Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
kingrichardiii@33515		And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
kingrichardiii@33564		No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
kingrichardiii@33609		Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
kingrichardiii@33652		Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
kingrichardiii@33696		Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
kingrichardiii@33740		Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
kingrichardiii@33779		The slave of nature and the son of hell!
kingrichardiii@33821		Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
kingrichardiii@33863		Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
kingrichardiii@33906		Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
kingrichardiii@33943	
kingrichardiii@33944	GLOUCESTER	Margaret.
kingrichardiii@33965	
kingrichardiii@33966	QUEEN MARGARET	        Richard!
kingrichardiii@33998	
kingrichardiii@33999	GLOUCESTER	                  Ha!
kingrichardiii@34032	
kingrichardiii@34033	QUEEN MARGARET	                  I call thee not.
kingrichardiii@34083	
kingrichardiii@34084	GLOUCESTER	I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
kingrichardiii@34136		That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
kingrichardiii@34187	
kingrichardiii@34188	QUEEN MARGARET	Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
kingrichardiii@34243		O, let me make the period to my curse!
kingrichardiii@34283	
kingrichardiii@34284	GLOUCESTER	'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
kingrichardiii@34336	
kingrichardiii@34337	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
kingrichardiii@34405	
kingrichardiii@34406	QUEEN MARGARET	Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
kingrichardiii@34470		Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
kingrichardiii@34519		Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
kingrichardiii@34559		Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
kingrichardiii@34610		The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
kingrichardiii@34658		To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
kingrichardiii@34711	
kingrichardiii@34712	HASTINGS	False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
kingrichardiii@34764		Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
kingrichardiii@34806	
kingrichardiii@34807	QUEEN MARGARET	Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
kingrichardiii@34868	
kingrichardiii@34869	RIVERS	Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
kingrichardiii@34929	
kingrichardiii@34930	QUEEN MARGARET	To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
kingrichardiii@34990		Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
kingrichardiii@35039		O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
kingrichardiii@35090	
kingrichardiii@35091	DORSET	Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
kingrichardiii@35136	
kingrichardiii@35137	QUEEN MARGARET	Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
kingrichardiii@35194		Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
kingrichardiii@35244		O, that your young nobility could judge
kingrichardiii@35285		What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
kingrichardiii@35328		They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
kingrichardiii@35382		And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
kingrichardiii@35433	
kingrichardiii@35434	GLOUCESTER	Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
kingrichardiii@35496	
kingrichardiii@35497	DORSET	It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
kingrichardiii@35545	
kingrichardiii@35546	GLOUCESTER	Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
kingrichardiii@35601		Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
kingrichardiii@35640		And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
kingrichardiii@35687	
kingrichardiii@35688	QUEEN MARGARET	And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
kingrichardiii@35743		Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
kingrichardiii@35787		Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
kingrichardiii@35836		Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
kingrichardiii@35873		Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
kingrichardiii@35913		O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
kingrichardiii@35954		As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
kingrichardiii@35996	
kingrichardiii@35997	BUCKINGHAM	Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
kingrichardiii@36050	
kingrichardiii@36051	QUEEN MARGARET	Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
kingrichardiii@36104		Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
kingrichardiii@36142		And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
kingrichardiii@36189		My charity is outrage, life my shame
kingrichardiii@36227		And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
kingrichardiii@36275	
kingrichardiii@36276	BUCKINGHAM	Have done, have done.
kingrichardiii@36309	
kingrichardiii@36310	QUEEN MARGARET	O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
kingrichardiii@36367		In sign of league and amity with thee:
kingrichardiii@36407		Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
kingrichardiii@36449		Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
kingrichardiii@36495		Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
kingrichardiii@36537	
kingrichardiii@36538	BUCKINGHAM	Nor no one here; for curses never pass
kingrichardiii@36588		The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
kingrichardiii@36637	
kingrichardiii@36638	QUEEN MARGARET	I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
kingrichardiii@36695		And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
kingrichardiii@36741		O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
kingrichardiii@36781		Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
kingrichardiii@36832		His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
kingrichardiii@36875		Have not to do with him, beware of him;
kingrichardiii@36916		Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
kingrichardiii@36967		And all their ministers attend on him.
kingrichardiii@37007	
kingrichardiii@37008	GLOUCESTER	What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
kingrichardiii@37061	
kingrichardiii@37062	BUCKINGHAM	Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
kingrichardiii@37115	
kingrichardiii@37116	QUEEN MARGARET	What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
kingrichardiii@37179		And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
kingrichardiii@37224		O, but remember this another day,
kingrichardiii@37259		When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
kingrichardiii@37308		And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
kingrichardiii@37349		Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
kingrichardiii@37393		And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
kingrichardiii@37436	
kingrichardiii@37437		[Exit]
kingrichardiii@37445	
kingrichardiii@37446	HASTINGS	My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
kingrichardiii@37501	
kingrichardiii@37502	RIVERS	And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
kingrichardiii@37556	
kingrichardiii@37557	GLOUCESTER	I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
kingrichardiii@37610		She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
kingrichardiii@37653		My part thereof that I have done to her.
kingrichardiii@37695	
kingrichardiii@37696	QUEEN ELIZABETH	I never did her any, to my knowledge.
kingrichardiii@37750	
kingrichardiii@37751	GLOUCESTER	But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
kingrichardiii@37805		I was too hot to do somebody good,
kingrichardiii@37841		That is too cold in thinking of it now.
kingrichardiii@37882		Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
kingrichardiii@37926		He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
kingrichardiii@37969		God pardon them that are the cause of it!
kingrichardiii@38012	
kingrichardiii@38013	RIVERS	A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
kingrichardiii@38064		To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
kingrichardiii@38111	
kingrichardiii@38112	GLOUCESTER	So do I ever:
kingrichardiii@38137	
kingrichardiii@38138		[Aside]
kingrichardiii@38147	
kingrichardiii@38148		being well-advised.
kingrichardiii@38169		For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
kingrichardiii@38213	
kingrichardiii@38214		[Enter CATESBY]
kingrichardiii@38231	
kingrichardiii@38232	CATESBY	Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
kingrichardiii@38278		And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
kingrichardiii@38324	
kingrichardiii@38325	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
kingrichardiii@38387	
kingrichardiii@38388	RIVERS	Madam, we will attend your grace.
kingrichardiii@38429	
kingrichardiii@38430		[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
kingrichardiii@38459	
kingrichardiii@38460	GLOUCESTER	I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
kingrichardiii@38513		The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
kingrichardiii@38554		I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
kingrichardiii@38597		Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
kingrichardiii@38647		I do beweep to many simple gulls
kingrichardiii@38681		Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
kingrichardiii@38722		And say it is the queen and her allies
kingrichardiii@38762		That stir the king against the duke my brother.
kingrichardiii@38811		Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
kingrichardiii@38853		To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
kingrichardiii@38895		But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
kingrichardiii@38945		Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
kingrichardiii@38991		And thus I clothe my naked villany
kingrichardiii@39027		With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
kingrichardiii@39071		And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
kingrichardiii@39118	
kingrichardiii@39119		[Enter two Murderers]
kingrichardiii@39142	
kingrichardiii@39143		But, soft! here come my executioners.
kingrichardiii@39182		How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
kingrichardiii@39224		Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
kingrichardiii@39266	
kingrichardiii@39267	First Murderer	We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
kingrichardiii@39328		That we may be admitted where he is.
kingrichardiii@39366	
kingrichardiii@39367	GLOUCESTER	Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
kingrichardiii@39422	
kingrichardiii@39423		[Gives the warrant]
kingrichardiii@39444	
kingrichardiii@39445		When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
kingrichardiii@39490		But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
kingrichardiii@39530		Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
kingrichardiii@39571		For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
kingrichardiii@39613		May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
kingrichardiii@39660	
kingrichardiii@39661	First Murderer	Tush!
kingrichardiii@39682		Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
kingrichardiii@39730		Talkers are no good doers: be assured
kingrichardiii@39769		We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
kingrichardiii@39816	
kingrichardiii@39817	GLOUCESTER	Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
kingrichardiii@39884		I like you, lads; about your business straight;
kingrichardiii@39933		Go, go, dispatch.
kingrichardiii@39952	
kingrichardiii@39953	First Murderer	                  We will, my noble lord.

kingrichardiii@40051	
kingrichardiii@40052	
kingrichardiii@40053	
kingrichardiii@40054	SCENE IV	London. The Tower.
kingrichardiii@40082	
kingrichardiii@40083	
kingrichardiii@40084		[Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY]
kingrichardiii@40117	
kingrichardiii@40118	BRAKENBURY	Why looks your grace so heavily today?
kingrichardiii@40168	
kingrichardiii@40169	CLARENCE	O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
kingrichardiii@40214		So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
kingrichardiii@40258		That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
kingrichardiii@40299		I would not spend another such a night,
kingrichardiii@40340		Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
kingrichardiii@40385		So full of dismal terror was the time!
kingrichardiii@40425	
kingrichardiii@40426	BRAKENBURY	What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
kingrichardiii@40486	
kingrichardiii@40487	CLARENCE	Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
kingrichardiii@40541		And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
kingrichardiii@40581		And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
kingrichardiii@40625		Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
kingrichardiii@40663		Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
kingrichardiii@40715		And cited up a thousand fearful times,
kingrichardiii@40755		During the wars of York and Lancaster
kingrichardiii@40794		That had befall'n us. As we paced along
kingrichardiii@40835		Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
kingrichardiii@40875		Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
kingrichardiii@40929		Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
kingrichardiii@40978		Into the tumbling billows of the main.
kingrichardiii@41018		Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
kingrichardiii@41069		What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
kingrichardiii@41114		What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
kingrichardiii@41159		Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
kingrichardiii@41203		Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
kingrichardiii@41246		Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
kingrichardiii@41294		Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
kingrichardiii@41332		All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
kingrichardiii@41373		Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
kingrichardiii@41425		Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
kingrichardiii@41473		As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
kingrichardiii@41519		Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
kingrichardiii@41562		And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
kingrichardiii@41612	
kingrichardiii@41613	BRAKENBURY	Had you such leisure in the time of death
kingrichardiii@41666		To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
kingrichardiii@41705	
kingrichardiii@41706	CLARENCE	Methought I had; and often did I strive
kingrichardiii@41755		To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
kingrichardiii@41804		Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
kingrichardiii@41849		To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
kingrichardiii@41893		But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
kingrichardiii@41935		Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
kingrichardiii@41979	
kingrichardiii@41980	BRAKENBURY	Awaked you not with this sore agony?
kingrichardiii@42028	
kingrichardiii@42029	CLARENCE	O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
kingrichardiii@42081		O, then began the tempest to my soul,
kingrichardiii@42120		Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
kingrichardiii@42166		With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
kingrichardiii@42213		Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
kingrichardiii@42251		The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
kingrichardiii@42301		Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
kingrichardiii@42348		Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
kingrichardiii@42392		Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
kingrichardiii@42440		And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
kingrichardiii@42484		A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
kingrichardiii@42526		Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
kingrichardiii@42572		'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
kingrichardiii@42628		That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
kingrichardiii@42672		Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
kingrichardiii@42723		With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
kingrichardiii@42771		Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
kingrichardiii@42816		Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
kingrichardiii@42862		I trembling waked, and for a season after
kingrichardiii@42905		Could not believe but that I was in hell,
kingrichardiii@42948		Such terrible impression made the dream.
kingrichardiii@42990	
kingrichardiii@42991	BRAKENBURY	No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
kingrichardiii@43048		I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
kingrichardiii@43093	
kingrichardiii@43094	CLARENCE	O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
kingrichardiii@43143		Which now bear evidence against my soul,
kingrichardiii@43185		For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
kingrichardiii@43233		O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
kingrichardiii@43281		But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
kingrichardiii@43323		Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
kingrichardiii@43359		O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
kingrichardiii@43409		I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
kingrichardiii@43450		My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
kingrichardiii@43493	
kingrichardiii@43494	BRAKENBURY	I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
kingrichardiii@43553	
kingrichardiii@43554		[CLARENCE sleeps]
kingrichardiii@43573	
kingrichardiii@43574		Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
kingrichardiii@43617		Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
kingrichardiii@43668		Princes have but their tides for their glories,
kingrichardiii@43717		An outward honour for an inward toil;
kingrichardiii@43756		And, for unfelt imagination,
kingrichardiii@43786		They often feel a world of restless cares:
kingrichardiii@43830		So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
kingrichardiii@43875		There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
kingrichardiii@43922	
kingrichardiii@43923		[Enter the two Murderers]
kingrichardiii@43950	
kingrichardiii@43951	First Murderer	Ho! who's here?
kingrichardiii@43982	
kingrichardiii@43983	BRAKENBURY	In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
kingrichardiii@44047	
kingrichardiii@44048	First Murderer	I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
kingrichardiii@44122	
kingrichardiii@44123	BRAKENBURY	Yea, are you so brief?
kingrichardiii@44157	
kingrichardiii@44158	Second Murderer	O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
kingrichardiii@44225		him our commission; talk no more.
kingrichardiii@44260	
kingrichardiii@44261		[BRAKENBURY reads it]
kingrichardiii@44284	
kingrichardiii@44285	BRAKENBURY	I am, in this, commanded to deliver
kingrichardiii@44332		The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
kingrichardiii@44375		I will not reason what is meant hereby,
kingrichardiii@44416		Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
kingrichardiii@44461		Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
kingrichardiii@44509		I'll to the king; and signify to him
kingrichardiii@44547		That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
kingrichardiii@44592	
kingrichardiii@44593	First Murderer	Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
kingrichardiii@44655	
kingrichardiii@44656		[Exit BRAKENBURY]
kingrichardiii@44675	
kingrichardiii@44676	Second Murderer	What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
kingrichardiii@44730	
kingrichardiii@44731	First Murderer	No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
kingrichardiii@44803	
kingrichardiii@44804	Second Murderer	When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
kingrichardiii@44871		the judgment-day.
kingrichardiii@44890	
kingrichardiii@44891	First Murderer	Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
kingrichardiii@44953	
kingrichardiii@44954	Second Murderer	The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
kingrichardiii@45022		of remorse in me.
kingrichardiii@45041	
kingrichardiii@45042	First Murderer	What, art thou afraid?
kingrichardiii@45080	
kingrichardiii@45081	Second Murderer	Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
kingrichardiii@45149		damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
kingrichardiii@45211	
kingrichardiii@45212	First Murderer	I thought thou hadst been resolute.
kingrichardiii@45263	
kingrichardiii@45264	Second Murderer	So I am, to let him live.
kingrichardiii@45306	
kingrichardiii@45307	First Murderer	Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
kingrichardiii@45367	
kingrichardiii@45368	Second Murderer	I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
kingrichardiii@45433		will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
kingrichardiii@45483		would tell twenty.
kingrichardiii@45503	
kingrichardiii@45504	First Murderer	How dost thou feel thyself now?
kingrichardiii@45551	
kingrichardiii@45552	Second Murderer	'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
kingrichardiii@45617		within me.
kingrichardiii@45629	
kingrichardiii@45630	First Murderer	Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
kingrichardiii@45689	
kingrichardiii@45690	Second Murderer	'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
kingrichardiii@45749	
kingrichardiii@45750	First Murderer	Where is thy conscience now?
kingrichardiii@45794	
kingrichardiii@45795	Second Murderer	In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
kingrichardiii@45846	
kingrichardiii@45847	First Murderer	So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
kingrichardiii@45912		thy conscience flies out.
kingrichardiii@45939	
kingrichardiii@45940	Second Murderer	Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
kingrichardiii@46006	
kingrichardiii@46007	First Murderer	How if it come to thee again?
kingrichardiii@46052	
kingrichardiii@46053	Second Murderer	I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
kingrichardiii@46122		makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
kingrichardiii@46172		accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
kingrichardiii@46224		he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
kingrichardiii@46273		detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
kingrichardiii@46325		mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
kingrichardiii@46374		obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
kingrichardiii@46426		that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
kingrichardiii@46478		is turned out of all towns and cities for a
kingrichardiii@46523		dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
kingrichardiii@46574		well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
kingrichardiii@46623		without it.
kingrichardiii@46636	
kingrichardiii@46637	First Murderer	'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
kingrichardiii@46703		not to kill the duke.
kingrichardiii@46726	
kingrichardiii@46727	Second Murderer	Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
kingrichardiii@46795		would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
kingrichardiii@46845	
kingrichardiii@46846	First Murderer	Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
kingrichardiii@46913		I warrant thee.
kingrichardiii@46930	
kingrichardiii@46931	Second Murderer	Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
kingrichardiii@46990		reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
kingrichardiii@47032	
kingrichardiii@47033	First Murderer	Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
kingrichardiii@47096		sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
kingrichardiii@47150		in the next room.
kingrichardiii@47169	
kingrichardiii@47170	Second Murderer	O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
kingrichardiii@47225	
kingrichardiii@47226	First Murderer	Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
kingrichardiii@47273	
kingrichardiii@47274	Second Murderer	No, first let's reason with him.
kingrichardiii@47323	
kingrichardiii@47324	CLARENCE	Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
kingrichardiii@47380	
kingrichardiii@47381	Second murderer	You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
kingrichardiii@47440	
kingrichardiii@47441	CLARENCE	In God's name, what art thou?
kingrichardiii@47480	
kingrichardiii@47481	Second Murderer	A man, as you are.
kingrichardiii@47516	
kingrichardiii@47517	CLARENCE	But not, as I am, royal.
kingrichardiii@47551	
kingrichardiii@47552	Second Murderer	Nor you, as we are, loyal.
kingrichardiii@47595	
kingrichardiii@47596	CLARENCE	Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
kingrichardiii@47653	
kingrichardiii@47654	Second Murderer	My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
kingrichardiii@47717	
kingrichardiii@47718	CLARENCE	How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
kingrichardiii@47770		Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
kingrichardiii@47814		Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
kingrichardiii@47859	
kingrichardiii@47860	Both	To, to, to--
kingrichardiii@47878	
kingrichardiii@47879	CLARENCE	To murder me?
kingrichardiii@47902	
kingrichardiii@47903	Both	Ay, ay.
kingrichardiii@47916	
kingrichardiii@47917	CLARENCE	You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
kingrichardiii@47970		And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
kingrichardiii@48018		Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
kingrichardiii@48061	
kingrichardiii@48062	First Murderer	Offended us you have not, but the king.
kingrichardiii@48117	
kingrichardiii@48118	CLARENCE	I shall be reconciled to him again.
kingrichardiii@48163	
kingrichardiii@48164	Second Murderer	Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
kingrichardiii@48222	
kingrichardiii@48223	CLARENCE	Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
kingrichardiii@48277		To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
kingrichardiii@48320		Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
kingrichardiii@48363		What lawful quest have given their verdict up
kingrichardiii@48410		Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
kingrichardiii@48454		The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
kingrichardiii@48500		Before I be convict by course of law,
kingrichardiii@48539		To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
kingrichardiii@48584		I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
kingrichardiii@48630		By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
kingrichardiii@48682		That you depart and lay no hands on me
kingrichardiii@48722		The deed you undertake is damnable.
kingrichardiii@48759	
kingrichardiii@48760	First Murderer	What we will do, we do upon command.
kingrichardiii@48812	
kingrichardiii@48813	Second Murderer	And he that hath commanded is the king.
kingrichardiii@48869	
kingrichardiii@48870	CLARENCE	Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
kingrichardiii@48921		Hath in the tables of his law commanded
kingrichardiii@48962		That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
kingrichardiii@49014		Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
kingrichardiii@49054		Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
kingrichardiii@49103		To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
kingrichardiii@49149	
kingrichardiii@49150	Second Murderer	And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
kingrichardiii@49212		For false forswearing and for murder too:
kingrichardiii@49255		Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
kingrichardiii@49295		To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
kingrichardiii@49343	
kingrichardiii@49344	First Murderer	And, like a traitor to the name of God,
kingrichardiii@49399		Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
kingrichardiii@49453		Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
kingrichardiii@49499	
kingrichardiii@49500	Second Murderer	Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
kingrichardiii@49560	
kingrichardiii@49561	First Murderer	How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
kingrichardiii@49622		When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
kingrichardiii@49666	
kingrichardiii@49667	CLARENCE	Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
kingrichardiii@49718		For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
kingrichardiii@49772		He sends ye not to murder me for this
kingrichardiii@49811		For in this sin he is as deep as I.
kingrichardiii@49848		If God will be revenged for this deed.
kingrichardiii@49888		O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
kingrichardiii@49927		Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
kingrichardiii@49972		He needs no indirect nor lawless course
kingrichardiii@50013		To cut off those that have offended him.
kingrichardiii@50055	
kingrichardiii@50056	First Murderer	Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
kingrichardiii@50111		When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
kingrichardiii@50154		That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
kingrichardiii@50202	
kingrichardiii@50203	CLARENCE	My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
kingrichardiii@50255	
kingrichardiii@50256	First Murderer	Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
kingrichardiii@50316		Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
kingrichardiii@50358	
kingrichardiii@50359	CLARENCE	Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
kingrichardiii@50409		I am his brother, and I love him well.
kingrichardiii@50449		If you be hired for meed, go back again,
kingrichardiii@50491		And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
kingrichardiii@50538		Who shall reward you better for my life
kingrichardiii@50579		Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
kingrichardiii@50622	
kingrichardiii@50623	Second Murderer	You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
kingrichardiii@50692	
kingrichardiii@50693	CLARENCE	O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
kingrichardiii@50744		Go you to him from me.
kingrichardiii@50768	
kingrichardiii@50769	Both	Ay, so we will.
kingrichardiii@50790	
kingrichardiii@50791	CLARENCE	Tell him, when that our princely father York
kingrichardiii@50845		Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
kingrichardiii@50894		And charged us from his soul to love each other,
kingrichardiii@50944		He little thought of this divided friendship:
kingrichardiii@50991		Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
kingrichardiii@51040	
kingrichardiii@51041	First Murderer	Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
kingrichardiii@51099	
kingrichardiii@51100	CLARENCE	O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
kingrichardiii@51148	
kingrichardiii@51149	First Murderer	Right,
kingrichardiii@51171		As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
kingrichardiii@51216		'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
kingrichardiii@51268	
kingrichardiii@51269	CLARENCE	It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
kingrichardiii@51320		He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
kingrichardiii@51369		That he would labour my delivery.
kingrichardiii@51404	
kingrichardiii@51405	Second Murderer	Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
kingrichardiii@51459		From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
kingrichardiii@51510	
kingrichardiii@51511	First Murderer	Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
kingrichardiii@51574	
kingrichardiii@51575	CLARENCE	Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
kingrichardiii@51625		To counsel me to make my peace with God,
kingrichardiii@51667		And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
kingrichardiii@51711		That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
kingrichardiii@51757		Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
kingrichardiii@51797		To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
kingrichardiii@51842	
kingrichardiii@51843	Second Murderer	What shall we do?
kingrichardiii@51877	
kingrichardiii@51878	CLARENCE	                  Relent, and save your souls.
kingrichardiii@51934	
kingrichardiii@51935	First Murderer	Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
kingrichardiii@51986	
kingrichardiii@51987	CLARENCE	Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
kingrichardiii@52040		Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
kingrichardiii@52083		Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
kingrichardiii@52122		if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
kingrichardiii@52172		Would not entreat for life?
kingrichardiii@52201		My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
kingrichardiii@52243		O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
kingrichardiii@52280		Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
kingrichardiii@52323		As you would beg, were you in my distress
kingrichardiii@52366		A begging prince what beggar pities not?
kingrichardiii@52408	
kingrichardiii@52409	Second Murderer	Look behind you, my lord.
kingrichardiii@52451	
kingrichardiii@52452	First Murderer	Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
kingrichardiii@52513	
kingrichardiii@52514		[Stabs him]
kingrichardiii@52527	
kingrichardiii@52528		I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
kingrichardiii@52572	
kingrichardiii@52573		[Exit, with the body]
kingrichardiii@52596	
kingrichardiii@52597	Second Murderer	A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
kingrichardiii@52656		How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
kingrichardiii@52702		Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
kingrichardiii@52745	
kingrichardiii@52746		[Re-enter First Murderer]
kingrichardiii@52773	
kingrichardiii@52774	First Murderer	How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
kingrichardiii@52843		By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
kingrichardiii@52896	
kingrichardiii@52897	Second Murderer	I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
kingrichardiii@52959		Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
kingrichardiii@53004		For I repent me that the duke is slain.
kingrichardiii@53045	
kingrichardiii@53046		[Exit]
kingrichardiii@53054	
kingrichardiii@53055	First Murderer	So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
kingrichardiii@53107		Now must I hide his body in some hole,
kingrichardiii@53147		Until the duke take order for his burial:
kingrichardiii@53190		And when I have my meed, I must away;
kingrichardiii@53229		For this will out, and here I must not stay.

kingrichardiii@53454	KING EDWARD IV	Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
kingrichardiii@53513		You peers, continue this united league:

kingrichardiii@53721		Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;

kingrichardiii@53812	
kingrichardiii@53813	RIVERS	By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:

kingrichardiii@53967	
kingrichardiii@53968	KING EDWARD IV	Take heed you dally not before your king;

kingrichardiii@54247	
kingrichardiii@54248	KING EDWARD IV	Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
kingrichardiii@54303		Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
kingrichardiii@54346		You have been factious one against the other,
kingrichardiii@54393		Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
kingrichardiii@54444		And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
kingrichardiii@54481	
kingrichardiii@54482	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
kingrichardiii@54541		Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
kingrichardiii@54583	
kingrichardiii@54584	KING EDWARD IV	Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
kingrichardiii@54650	
kingrichardiii@54651	DORSET	This interchange of love, I here protest,
kingrichardiii@54700		Upon my part shall be unviolable.

kingrichardiii@55131		When I have most need to employ a friend,
kingrichardiii@55174		And most assured that he is a friend
kingrichardiii@55212		Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,

kingrichardiii@55297		When I am cold in zeal to yours.
kingrichardiii@55331	
kingrichardiii@55332	KING EDWARD IV	A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,

kingrichardiii@55697	KING EDWARD IV	Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
kingrichardiii@55753		Brother, we done deeds of charity;
kingrichardiii@55789		Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
kingrichardiii@55828		Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
kingrichardiii@55874	
kingrichardiii@55875	GLOUCESTER	A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
kingrichardiii@55929		Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
kingrichardiii@55971		By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
kingrichardiii@56013		Hold me a foe;
kingrichardiii@56029		If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
kingrichardiii@56063		Have aught committed that is hardly borne
kingrichardiii@56106		By any in this presence, I desire
kingrichardiii@56141		To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
kingrichardiii@56181		'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
kingrichardiii@56216		I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
kingrichardiii@56260		First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
kingrichardiii@56304		Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
kingrichardiii@56352		Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
kingrichardiii@56389		If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
kingrichardiii@56433		Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
kingrichardiii@56479		That without desert have frown'd on me;
kingrichardiii@56520		Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
kingrichardiii@56569		I do not know that Englishman alive
kingrichardiii@56606		With whom my soul is any jot at odds
kingrichardiii@56644		More than the infant that is born to-night
kingrichardiii@56688		I thank my God for my humility.
kingrichardiii@56721	
kingrichardiii@56722	QUEEN ELIZABETH	A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
kingrichardiii@56779		I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
kingrichardiii@56829		My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
kingrichardiii@56876		To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
kingrichardiii@56921	
kingrichardiii@56922	GLOUCESTER	Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
kingrichardiii@56974		To be so bouted in this royal presence?
kingrichardiii@57015		Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
kingrichardiii@57059

kingrichardiii@57281	
kingrichardiii@57282	DORSET	Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
kingrichardiii@57335		But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
kingrichardiii@57380	
kingrichardiii@57381	KING EDWARD IV	Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
kingrichardiii@57438	
kingrichardiii@57439	GLOUCESTER	But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
kingrichardiii@57495		And that a winged Mercury did bear:
kingrichardiii@57532		Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
kingrichardiii@57574		That came too lag to see him buried.
kingrichardiii@57612		God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
kingrichardiii@57661		Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,

kingrichardiii@57973

kingrichardiii@58035	
kingrichardiii@58036	DORSET	The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
kingrichardiii@58089		Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
kingrichardiii@58128		Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
kingrichardiii@58170	
kingrichardiii@58171	KING EDWARD IV	Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
kingrichardiii@58228		And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
kingrichardiii@58272		My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
kingrichardiii@58320		And yet his punishment was cruel death.
kingrichardiii@58361		Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
kingrichardiii@58403		Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
kingrichardiii@58447		Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
kingrichardiii@58493		Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
kingrichardiii@58536		The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
kingrichardiii@58579		Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
kingrichardiii@58619		When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
kingrichardiii@58660		And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
kingrichardiii@58708		Who told me, when we both lay in the field
kingrichardiii@58752		Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
kingrichardiii@58795		Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
kingrichardiii@58840		All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
kingrichardiii@58885		All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
kingrichardiii@58929		Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
kingrichardiii@58969		Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
kingrichardiii@59010		But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
kingrichardiii@59057		Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
kingrichardiii@59101		The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
kingrichardiii@59143		You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
kingrichardiii@59195		And I unjustly too, must grant it you
kingrichardiii@59234		But for my brother not a man would speak,
kingrichardiii@59277		Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
kingrichardiii@59315		For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
kingrichardiii@59360		Have been beholding to him in his life;
kingrichardiii@59401		Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
kingrichardiii@59449		O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
kingrichardiii@59491		On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
kingrichardiii@59538		Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
kingrichardiii@59577		Oh, poor Clarence!

kingrichardiii@59598		[Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET]

kingrichardiii@59804		O, they did urge it still unto the king!

kingrichardiii@60144	DUCHESS OF YORK	No, boy.
kingrichardiii@60169	
kingrichardiii@60170	Boy	Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
kingrichardiii@60225		And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
kingrichardiii@60264	
kingrichardiii@60265	Girl	Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
kingrichardiii@60314		And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
kingrichardiii@60356		If that our noble father be alive?
kingrichardiii@60392	
kingrichardiii@60393	DUCHESS OF YORK	My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
kingrichardiii@60449		I do lament the sickness of the king.
kingrichardiii@60488		As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
kingrichardiii@60536		It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
kingrichardiii@60582	
kingrichardiii@60583	Boy	Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
kingrichardiii@60632		The king my uncle is to blame for this:
kingrichardiii@60673		God will revenge it; whom I will importune
kingrichardiii@60717		With daily prayers all to that effect.

kingrichardiii@60848		Incapable and shallow innocents,
kingrichardiii@60882		You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
kingrichardiii@60932	
kingrichardiii@60933	Boy	Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
kingrichardiii@60983		Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
kingrichardiii@61026		Devised impeachments to imprison him :
kingrichardiii@61066		And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
kingrichardiii@61106		And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
kingrichardiii@61161		Bade me rely on him as on my father,
kingrichardiii@61199		And he would love me dearly as his child.
kingrichardiii@61242	
kingrichardiii@61243	DUCHESS OF YORK	Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
kingrichardiii@61308		And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
kingrichardiii@61353		He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
kingrichardiii@61395		Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

kingrichardiii@62259	DUCHESS OF YORK	Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow

kingrichardiii@62396		And lived by looking on his images:
kingrichardiii@62433		But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
kingrichardiii@62480		Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,

kingrichardiii@62614		Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
kingrichardiii@62656		And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
kingrichardiii@62705		But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
kingrichardiii@62757		And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,

kingrichardiii@67151		As index to the story we late talk'd of,

kingrichardiii@67646		Hear you the news abroad?
kingrichardiii@67673	
kingrichardiii@67674	First Citizen	Ay, that the king is dead.
kingrichardiii@67715	
kingrichardiii@67716	Second Citizen	Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
kingrichardiii@67777		I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
kingrichardiii@67825	
kingrichardiii@67826		[Enter another Citizen]
kingrichardiii@67851	
kingrichardiii@67852	Third Citizen	Neighbours, God speed!
kingrichardiii@67889	
kingrichardiii@67890	First Citizen	Give you good morrow, sir.
kingrichardiii@67931	
kingrichardiii@67932	Third Citizen	Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
kingrichardiii@67995	
kingrichardiii@67996	Second Citizen	Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
kingrichardiii@68056	
kingrichardiii@68057	Third Citizen	Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
kingrichardiii@68117	
kingrichardiii@68118	First Citizen	No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
kingrichardiii@68181	
kingrichardiii@68182	Third Citizen	Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
kingrichardiii@68240	
kingrichardiii@68241	Second Citizen	In him there is a hope of government,
kingrichardiii@68294		That in his nonage council under him,
kingrichardiii@68333		And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
kingrichardiii@68377		No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
kingrichardiii@68426	
kingrichardiii@68427	First Citizen	So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
kingrichardiii@68481		Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
kingrichardiii@68527	
kingrichardiii@68528	Third Citizen	Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
kingrichardiii@68593		For then this land was famously enrich'd
kingrichardiii@68635		With politic grave counsel; then the king
kingrichardiii@68678		Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
kingrichardiii@68721	
kingrichardiii@68722	First Citizen	Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
kingrichardiii@68786	
kingrichardiii@68787	Third Citizen	Better it were they all came by the father,
kingrichardiii@68845		Or by the father there were none at all;
kingrichardiii@68887		For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
kingrichardiii@68929		Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
kingrichardiii@68978		O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
kingrichardiii@69024		And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:

kingrichardiii@69122		This sickly land might solace as before.

kingrichardiii@69612		That looks not heavily and full of fear.
kingrichardiii@69654	
kingrichardiii@69655	Third Citizen	Before the times of change, still is it so:
kingrichardiii@69713		By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
kingrichardiii@69756		Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
kingrichardiii@69794		The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
kingrichardiii@69839		But leave it all to God. whither away?

kingrichardiii@70151	
kingrichardiii@70152	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
kingrichardiii@70216		At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
kingrichardiii@70259		To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
kingrichardiii@70303	
kingrichardiii@70304	DUCHESS OF YORK	I long with all my heart to see the prince:
kingrichardiii@70364		I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
kingrichardiii@70411	
kingrichardiii@70412	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But I hear, no; they say my son of York
kingrichardiii@70468		Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
kingrichardiii@70510	
kingrichardiii@70511	YORK	Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
kingrichardiii@70556	
kingrichardiii@70557	DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
kingrichardiii@70615	
kingrichardiii@70616	YORK	Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
kingrichardiii@70666		My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
kingrichardiii@70705		More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
kingrichardiii@70749		Gloucester,
kingrichardiii@70762		'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
kingrichardiii@70816		And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
kingrichardiii@70864		Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
kingrichardiii@70918	
kingrichardiii@70919	DUCHESS OF YORK	Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
kingrichardiii@70983		In him that did object the same to thee;
kingrichardiii@71025		He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
kingrichardiii@71074		So long a-growing and so leisurely,
kingrichardiii@71111		That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
kingrichardiii@71165	
kingrichardiii@71166	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
kingrichardiii@71218	
kingrichardiii@71219	DUCHESS OF YORK	I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
kingrichardiii@71276	
kingrichardiii@71277	YORK	Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
kingrichardiii@71326		I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
kingrichardiii@71372		To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
kingrichardiii@71422	
kingrichardiii@71423	DUCHESS OF YORK	How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
kingrichardiii@71489	
kingrichardiii@71490	YORK	Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
kingrichardiii@71533		That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
kingrichardiii@71578		'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
kingrichardiii@71625		Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
kingrichardiii@71671	
kingrichardiii@71672	DUCHESS OF YORK	I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
kingrichardiii@71734	
kingrichardiii@71735	YORK	Grandam, his nurse.
kingrichardiii@71760	
kingrichardiii@71761	DUCHESS OF YORK	His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.

kingrichardiii@73048		And often up and down my sons were toss'd,

kingrichardiii@73137		And being seated, and domestic broils
kingrichardiii@73176		Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
kingrichardiii@73223		Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
kingrichardiii@73271		Self against self: O, preposterous
kingrichardiii@73307		And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
kingrichardiii@73352		Or let me die, to look on death no more!

kingrichardiii@74082	
kingrichardiii@74083	GLOUCESTER	Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
kingrichardiii@74139		The weary way hath made you melancholy.
kingrichardiii@74180	
kingrichardiii@74181	PRINCE EDWARD	No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
kingrichardiii@74233		Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
kingrichardiii@74277		I want more uncles here to welcome me.
kingrichardiii@74317	
kingrichardiii@74318	GLOUCESTER	Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
kingrichardiii@74378		Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
kingrichardiii@74422		Nor more can you distinguish of a man
kingrichardiii@74461		Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
kingrichardiii@74509		Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
kingrichardiii@74550		Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
kingrichardiii@74595		Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,

kingrichardiii@75726		Unto his princely brother presently?
kingrichardiii@75764		If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
kingrichardiii@75806		And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

kingrichardiii@75854	CARDINAL	My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
kingrichardiii@75905		Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
kingrichardiii@75948		Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
kingrichardiii@75994		To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid

kingrichardiii@76245		Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
kingrichardiii@76291		You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
kingrichardiii@76332		The benefit thereof is always granted
kingrichardiii@76371		To those whose dealings have deserved the place,

kingrichardiii@77385	
kingrichardiii@77386	BUCKINGHAM	He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
kingrichardiii@77441		Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
kingrichardiii@77489	
kingrichardiii@77490	PRINCE EDWARD	Is it upon record, or else reported
kingrichardiii@77540		Successively from age to age, he built it?

kingrichardiii@77585	BUCKINGHAM	Upon record, my gracious lord.
kingrichardiii@77627	
kingrichardiii@77628	PRINCE EDWARD	But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
kingrichardiii@77684		Methinks the truth should live from age to age,

kingrichardiii@77866		live long.
kingrichardiii@77878	
kingrichardiii@77879	PRINCE EDWARD	What say you, uncle?
kingrichardiii@77914	
kingrichardiii@77915	GLOUCESTER	I say, without characters, fame lives long.
kingrichardiii@77970	
kingrichardiii@77971		[Aside]
kingrichardiii@77980	
kingrichardiii@77981		Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
kingrichardiii@78020		I moralize two meanings in one word.
kingrichardiii@78058	
kingrichardiii@78059	PRINCE EDWARD	That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
kingrichardiii@78110		With what his valour did enrich his wit,
kingrichardiii@78152		His wit set down to make his valour live
kingrichardiii@78194		Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
kingrichardiii@78238		For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
kingrichardiii@78285		I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
kingrichardiii@78330	
kingrichardiii@78331	BUCKINGHAM	What, my gracious lord?
kingrichardiii@78366	
kingrichardiii@78367	PRINCE EDWARD	An if I live until I be a man,
kingrichardiii@78412		I'll win our ancient right in France again,
kingrichardiii@78457		Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
kingrichardiii@78495	
kingrichardiii@78496	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.

kingrichardiii@78562		[Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL]
kingrichardiii@78610	
kingrichardiii@78611	BUCKINGHAM	Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
kingrichardiii@78670	
kingrichardiii@78671	PRINCE EDWARD	Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
kingrichardiii@78732	
kingrichardiii@78733	YORK	Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
kingrichardiii@78783	
kingrichardiii@78784	PRINCE EDWARD	Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
kingrichardiii@78841		Too late he died that might have kept that title,
kingrichardiii@78892		Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
kingrichardiii@78936	
kingrichardiii@78937	GLOUCESTER	How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
kingrichardiii@78990	
kingrichardiii@78991	YORK	I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
kingrichardiii@79035		You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
kingrichardiii@79080		The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
kingrichardiii@79125	
kingrichardiii@79126	GLOUCESTER	He hath, my lord.
kingrichardiii@79155	
kingrichardiii@79156	YORK	                  And therefore is he idle?
kingrichardiii@79205	
kingrichardiii@79206	GLOUCESTER	O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
kingrichardiii@79255	
kingrichardiii@79256	YORK	Then is he more beholding to you than I.
kingrichardiii@79302	
kingrichardiii@79303	GLOUCESTER	He may command me as my sovereign;
kingrichardiii@79349		But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
kingrichardiii@79392	
kingrichardiii@79393	YORK	I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
kingrichardiii@79438	
kingrichardiii@79439	GLOUCESTER	My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
kingrichardiii@79495	
kingrichardiii@79496	PRINCE EDWARD	A beggar, brother?
kingrichardiii@79529	
kingrichardiii@79530	YORK	Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
kingrichardiii@79576		And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
kingrichardiii@79625	
kingrichardiii@79626	GLOUCESTER	A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
kingrichardiii@79683	
kingrichardiii@79684	YORK	A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
kingrichardiii@79732	
kingrichardiii@79733	GLOUCESTER	A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
kingrichardiii@79783	
kingrichardiii@79784	YORK	O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
kingrichardiii@79841		In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
kingrichardiii@79887	
kingrichardiii@79888	GLOUCESTER	It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
kingrichardiii@79939	
kingrichardiii@79940	YORK	I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
kingrichardiii@79982	
kingrichardiii@79983	GLOUCESTER	What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
kingrichardiii@80039	
kingrichardiii@80040	YORK	I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
kingrichardiii@80093	
kingrichardiii@80094	GLOUCESTER	How?
kingrichardiii@80110	
kingrichardiii@80111	YORK	Little.
kingrichardiii@80124	
kingrichardiii@80125	PRINCE EDWARD	My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
kingrichardiii@80184		Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
kingrichardiii@80231	
kingrichardiii@80232	YORK	You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
kingrichardiii@80280		Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
kingrichardiii@80322		Because that I am little, like an ape,
kingrichardiii@80362		He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
kingrichardiii@80416	
kingrichardiii@80417	BUCKINGHAM	With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
kingrichardiii@80471		To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
kingrichardiii@80514		He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
kingrichardiii@80553		So cunning and so young is wonderful.
kingrichardiii@80592	
kingrichardiii@80593	GLOUCESTER	My lord, will't please you pass along?
kingrichardiii@80643		Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
kingrichardiii@80681		Will to your mother, to entreat of her
kingrichardiii@80721		To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
kingrichardiii@80764	
kingrichardiii@80765	YORK	What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
kingrichardiii@80813	
kingrichardiii@80814	PRINCE EDWARD	My lord protector needs will have it so.
kingrichardiii@80869	
kingrichardiii@80870	YORK	I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
kingrichardiii@80916	
kingrichardiii@80917	GLOUCESTER	Why, what should you fear?
kingrichardiii@80955	
kingrichardiii@80956	YORK	Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
kingrichardiii@81000		My grandam told me he was murdered there.
kingrichardiii@81043	
kingrichardiii@81044	PRINCE EDWARD	I fear no uncles dead.
kingrichardiii@81081	
kingrichardiii@81082	GLOUCESTER	Nor none that live, I hope.
kingrichardiii@81121	
kingrichardiii@81122	PRINCE EDWARD	An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
kingrichardiii@81177		But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
kingrichardiii@81221		Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.

kingrichardiii@81327	BUCKINGHAM	Think you, my lord, this little prating York
kingrichardiii@81383		Was not incensed by his subtle mother
kingrichardiii@81422		To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
kingrichardiii@81466

kingrichardiii@81521		Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
kingrichardiii@81563		He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
kingrichardiii@81609	
kingrichardiii@81610	BUCKINGHAM	Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
kingrichardiii@81664		Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
kingrichardiii@81715		As closely to conceal what we impart:
kingrichardiii@81754		Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
kingrichardiii@81800		What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
kingrichardiii@81846		To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
kingrichardiii@81890		For the instalment of this noble duke
kingrichardiii@81929		In the seat royal of this famous isle?
kingrichardiii@81969	
kingrichardiii@81970	CATESBY	He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
kingrichardiii@82024		That he will not be won to aught against him.
kingrichardiii@82071	
kingrichardiii@82072	BUCKINGHAM	What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
kingrichardiii@82135	
kingrichardiii@82136	CATESBY	He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
kingrichardiii@82184	
kingrichardiii@82185	BUCKINGHAM	Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
kingrichardiii@82246		And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
kingrichardiii@82297		How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
kingrichardiii@82341		And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
kingrichardiii@82381		To sit about the coronation.
kingrichardiii@82411		If thou dost find him tractable to us,
kingrichardiii@82451		Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
kingrichardiii@82497		If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
kingrichardiii@82536		Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
kingrichardiii@82581		And give us notice of his inclination:
kingrichardiii@82621		For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
kingrichardiii@82662		Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
kingrichardiii@82705

kingrichardiii@82898		Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

kingrichardiii@83329	
kingrichardiii@83330	GLOUCESTER	Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
kingrichardiii@83386		And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
kingrichardiii@83431		The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
kingrichardiii@83475		Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
kingrichardiii@83521

kingrichardiii@83954	
kingrichardiii@83955		[Enter HASTINGS]
kingrichardiii@83973	
kingrichardiii@83974	HASTINGS	What is't o'clock?

kingrichardiii@84039	HASTINGS	Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
kingrichardiii@84094

kingrichardiii@84195	HASTINGS	And then?
kingrichardiii@84214	
kingrichardiii@84215	Messenger	And then he sends you word
kingrichardiii@84252		He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
kingrichardiii@84301		Besides, he says there are two councils held;
kingrichardiii@84348		And that may be determined at the one
kingrichardiii@84387		which may make you and him to rue at the other.
kingrichardiii@84436		Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
kingrichardiii@84490		If presently you will take horse with him,
kingrichardiii@84534		And with all speed post with him toward the north,
kingrichardiii@84586		To shun the danger that his soul divines.
kingrichardiii@84629

kingrichardiii@84677		Bid him not fear the separated councils
kingrichardiii@84718		His honour and myself are at the one,
kingrichardiii@84757		And at the other is my servant Catesby
kingrichardiii@84797		Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
kingrichardiii@84841		Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
kingrichardiii@84881		Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
kingrichardiii@84932		And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
kingrichardiii@84976		To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
kingrichardiii@85018		To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
kingrichardiii@85060		Were to incense the boar to follow us
kingrichardiii@85099		And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
kingrichardiii@85145		Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
kingrichardiii@85185		And we will both together to the Tower,
kingrichardiii@85226		Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.

kingrichardiii@85707	CATESBY	Ay, my good lord.
kingrichardiii@85733	
kingrichardiii@85734	HASTINGS	I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders

kingrichardiii@85885	
kingrichardiii@85886	CATESBY	Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
kingrichardiii@85936		Upon his party for the gain thereof:
kingrichardiii@85974		And thereupon he sends you this good news,
kingrichardiii@86018		That this same very day your enemies,
kingrichardiii@86057		The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
kingrichardiii@86105	
kingrichardiii@86106	HASTINGS	Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
kingrichardiii@86154		Because they have been still mine enemies:
kingrichardiii@86198		But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
kingrichardiii@86247		To bar my master's heirs in true descent,

kingrichardiii@86388	
kingrichardiii@86389	HASTINGS	But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
kingrichardiii@86446		That they who brought me in my master's hate
kingrichardiii@86492		I live to look upon their tragedy.
kingrichardiii@86528		I tell thee, Catesby--

kingrichardiii@86577	HASTINGS	Ere a fortnight make me elder,
kingrichardiii@86617		I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
kingrichardiii@86667	
kingrichardiii@86668	CATESBY	'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
kingrichardiii@86720		When men are unprepared and look not for it.
kingrichardiii@86766	
kingrichardiii@86767	HASTINGS	O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
kingrichardiii@86820		With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
kingrichardiii@86866		With some men else, who think themselves as safe
kingrichardiii@86916		As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
kingrichardiii@86963		To princely Richard and to Buckingham.

kingrichardiii@87329		You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
kingrichardiii@87370		I do not like these several councils, I.
kingrichardiii@87412	
kingrichardiii@87413	HASTINGS	My lord,
kingrichardiii@87431		I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
kingrichardiii@87472		And never in my life, I do protest,
kingrichardiii@87509		Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
kingrichardiii@87552		Think you, but that I know our state secure,
kingrichardiii@87598		I would be so triumphant as I am?
kingrichardiii@87633	
kingrichardiii@87634	STANLEY	The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
kingrichardiii@87692		Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
kingrichardiii@87741		And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
kingrichardiii@87784		But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
kingrichardiii@87829		This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
kingrichardiii@87870		Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
kingrichardiii@87915		What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
kingrichardiii@87967	
kingrichardiii@87968	HASTINGS	Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
kingrichardiii@88027		To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
kingrichardiii@88071	
kingrichardiii@88072	LORD STANLEY	They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
kingrichardiii@88138		Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
kingrichardiii@88189		But come, my lord, let us away.
kingrichardiii@88222	
kingrichardiii@88223		[Enter a Pursuivant]
kingrichardiii@88245	
kingrichardiii@88246	HASTINGS	Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.

kingrichardiii@88303		[Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY]
kingrichardiii@88333	
kingrichardiii@88334		How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
kingrichardiii@88382	
kingrichardiii@88383	Pursuivant	The better that your lordship please to ask.
kingrichardiii@88439	
kingrichardiii@88440	HASTINGS	I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
kingrichardiii@88491		Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
kingrichardiii@88537		Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
kingrichardiii@88578		By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
kingrichardiii@88620		But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
kingrichardiii@88664		This day those enemies are put to death,
kingrichardiii@88706		And I in better state than e'er I was.
kingrichardiii@88746	
kingrichardiii@88747	Pursuivant	God hold it, to your honour's good content!
kingrichardiii@88802	
kingrichardiii@88803	HASTINGS	Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
kingrichardiii@88856

kingrichardiii@88946	Priest	Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
kingrichardiii@89002	
kingrichardiii@89003	HASTINGS	I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
kingrichardiii@89060		I am in your debt for your last exercise;
kingrichardiii@89103		Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
kingrichardiii@89151

kingrichardiii@89199	
kingrichardiii@89200	BUCKINGHAM	What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
kingrichardiii@89258		Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
kingrichardiii@89309		Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
kingrichardiii@89353	
kingrichardiii@89354	HASTINGS	Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
kingrichardiii@89405		Those men you talk of came into my mind.
kingrichardiii@89447		What, go you toward the Tower?
kingrichardiii@89479	
kingrichardiii@89480	BUCKINGHAM	I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
kingrichardiii@89532		I shall return before your lordship thence.
kingrichardiii@89577	
kingrichardiii@89578	HASTINGS	'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
kingrichardiii@89630	
kingrichardiii@89631	BUCKINGHAM	[Aside]  And supper too, although thou know'st it not.
kingrichardiii@89697		Come, will you go?

kingrichardiii@89953	
kingrichardiii@89954	RIVERS	Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
kingrichardiii@90006		To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
kingrichardiii@90046		For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
kingrichardiii@90085	
kingrichardiii@90086	GREY	God keep the prince from all the pack of you!

kingrichardiii@90283	
kingrichardiii@90284	RIVERS	O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
kingrichardiii@90333		Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
kingrichardiii@90368		Within the guilty closure of thy walls
kingrichardiii@90408		Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
kingrichardiii@90454		And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
kingrichardiii@90497		We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
kingrichardiii@90544	
kingrichardiii@90545	GREY	Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
kingrichardiii@90597		For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
kingrichardiii@90644	
kingrichardiii@90645	RIVERS	Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
kingrichardiii@90706		Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
kingrichardiii@90749		To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
kingrichardiii@90794		And for my sister and her princely sons,
kingrichardiii@90836		Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
kingrichardiii@90882		Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

kingrichardiii@91283	
kingrichardiii@91284	HASTINGS	My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
kingrichardiii@91337		Is, to determine of the coronation.
kingrichardiii@91374		In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
kingrichardiii@91420	
kingrichardiii@91421	BUCKINGHAM	Are all things fitting for that royal time?

kingrichardiii@91477	DERBY	It is, and wants but nomination.

kingrichardiii@91517	BISHOP OF ELY	To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
kingrichardiii@91569

kingrichardiii@91625		Who is most inward with the royal duke?
kingrichardiii@91666	
kingrichardiii@91667	BISHOP OF ELY	Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

kingrichardiii@91734	BUCKINGHAM	Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
kingrichardiii@91791		But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
kingrichardiii@91838		Than I of yours;
kingrichardiii@91856		Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
kingrichardiii@91897		Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
kingrichardiii@91942	
kingrichardiii@91943	HASTINGS	I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
kingrichardiii@91996		But, for his purpose in the coronation.
kingrichardiii@92037		I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
kingrichardiii@92079		His gracious pleasure any way therein:

kingrichardiii@92396		I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
kingrichardiii@92438		My absence doth neglect no great designs,
kingrichardiii@92481		Which by my presence might have been concluded.
kingrichardiii@92530	
kingrichardiii@92531	BUCKINGHAM	Had not you come upon your cue, my lord

kingrichardiii@93269		His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
kingrichardiii@93318		Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
kingrichardiii@93363

kingrichardiii@93806		There's some conceit or other likes him well,
kingrichardiii@93853		When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
kingrichardiii@93903		I think there's never a man in Christendom
kingrichardiii@93947		That can less hide his love or hate than he;
kingrichardiii@93993		For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
kingrichardiii@94045	
kingrichardiii@94046	DERBY	What of his heart perceive you in his face
kingrichardiii@94095		By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
kingrichardiii@94132	
kingrichardiii@94133	HASTINGS	Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
kingrichardiii@94187		For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
kingrichardiii@94232	
kingrichardiii@94233	DERBY	I pray God he be not, I say.

kingrichardiii@94361		That do conspire my death with devilish plots
kingrichardiii@94408		Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
kingrichardiii@94455		Upon my body with their hellish charms?
kingrichardiii@94496	
kingrichardiii@94497	HASTINGS	The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,

kingrichardiii@94596		To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
kingrichardiii@94639		I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
kingrichardiii@94682	
kingrichardiii@94683	GLOUCESTER	Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
kingrichardiii@94737		See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
kingrichardiii@94778		Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
kingrichardiii@94820		And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
kingrichardiii@94870		Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
kingrichardiii@94914		That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
kingrichardiii@94961	
kingrichardiii@94962	HASTINGS	If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
kingrichardiii@95020	
kingrichardiii@95021	GLOUCESTER	If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
kingrichardiii@95078		Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
kingrichardiii@95126		Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
kingrichardiii@95174		I will not dine until I see the same.
kingrichardiii@95213		Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
kingrichardiii@95256		The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.

kingrichardiii@95401		For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
kingrichardiii@95446		Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
kingrichardiii@95493		But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
kingrichardiii@95536		Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
kingrichardiii@95589		And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
kingrichardiii@95635		As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
kingrichardiii@95680		O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
kingrichardiii@95724		I now repent I told the pursuivant
kingrichardiii@95760		As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
kingrichardiii@95799		How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
kingrichardiii@95845		And I myself secure in grace and favour.
kingrichardiii@95887		O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
kingrichardiii@95930		Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
kingrichardiii@95975	
kingrichardiii@95976	RATCLIFF	Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
kingrichardiii@96033		Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
kingrichardiii@96082	
kingrichardiii@96083	HASTINGS	O momentary grace of mortal men,
kingrichardiii@96125		Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
kingrichardiii@96172		Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
kingrichardiii@96221		Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
kingrichardiii@96261		Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
kingrichardiii@96300		Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
kingrichardiii@96336	
kingrichardiii@96337	LOVEL	Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.

kingrichardiii@96438		I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
kingrichardiii@96478		That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.

kingrichardiii@97841		The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
kingrichardiii@97882	
kingrichardiii@97883	GLOUCESTER	So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
kingrichardiii@97937		I took him for the plainest harmless creature
kingrichardiii@97984		That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
kingrichardiii@98028		Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
kingrichardiii@98071		The history of all her secret thoughts:
kingrichardiii@98112		So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
kingrichardiii@98163		That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
kingrichardiii@98203		I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
kingrichardiii@98248		He lived from all attainder of suspect.
kingrichardiii@98289	
kingrichardiii@98290	BUCKINGHAM	Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
kingrichardiii@98352		That ever lived.
kingrichardiii@98370		Would you imagine, or almost believe,
kingrichardiii@98409		Were't not that, by great preservation,
kingrichardiii@98450		We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor

kingrichardiii@98613

kingrichardiii@98667		Or that we would, against the form of law,
kingrichardiii@98711		Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
kingrichardiii@98756		But that the extreme peril of the case,
kingrichardiii@98797		The peace of England and our persons' safety,
kingrichardiii@98844		Enforced us to this execution?
kingrichardiii@98876	
kingrichardiii@98877	Lord Mayor	Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
kingrichardiii@98933		And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
kingrichardiii@98983		To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
kingrichardiii@99031		I never look'd for better at his hands,
kingrichardiii@99072		After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
kingrichardiii@99116	
kingrichardiii@99117	GLOUCESTER	Yet had not we determined he should die,
kingrichardiii@99169		Until your lordship came to see his death;
kingrichardiii@99213		Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
kingrichardiii@99263		Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
kingrichardiii@99310		Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
kingrichardiii@99357		The traitor speak, and timorously confess
kingrichardiii@99400		The manner and the purpose of his treason;
kingrichardiii@99444		That you might well have signified the same
kingrichardiii@99489		Unto the citizens, who haply may
kingrichardiii@99523		Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
kingrichardiii@99566	
kingrichardiii@99567	Lord Mayor	But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
kingrichardiii@99628		As well as I had seen and heard him speak
kingrichardiii@99671		And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
kingrichardiii@99717		But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens

kingrichardiii@99804

kingrichardiii@100172		There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
kingrichardiii@100219		Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
kingrichardiii@100261		Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
kingrichardiii@100307		Only for saying he would make his son
kingrichardiii@100346		Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
kingrichardiii@100392		Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
kingrichardiii@100435		Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
kingrichardiii@100470		And bestial appetite in change of lust;
kingrichardiii@100511		Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
kingrichardiii@100565		Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
kingrichardiii@100610		Without control, listed to make his prey.
kingrichardiii@100653		Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
kingrichardiii@100701		Tell them, when that my mother went with child
kingrichardiii@100749		Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
kingrichardiii@100787		My princely father then had wars in France
kingrichardiii@100831		And, by just computation of the time,
kingrichardiii@100870		Found that the issue was not his begot;
kingrichardiii@100911		Which well appeared in his lineaments,
kingrichardiii@100951		Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
kingrichardiii@100997		But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
kingrichardiii@101043		Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
kingrichardiii@101088	
kingrichardiii@101089	BUCKINGHAM	Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
kingrichardiii@101140		As if the golden fee for which I plead
kingrichardiii@101180		Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
kingrichardiii@101222	
kingrichardiii@101223	GLOUCESTER	If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
kingrichardiii@101286		Where you shall find me well accompanied
kingrichardiii@101328		With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
kingrichardiii@101377	
kingrichardiii@101378	BUCKINGHAM	I go: and towards three or four o'clock

kingrichardiii@102123		And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
kingrichardiii@102169		Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
kingrichardiii@102209		For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;

kingrichardiii@102957

kingrichardiii@103010		And his contract by deputy in France;
kingrichardiii@103049		The insatiate greediness of his desires,

kingrichardiii@103218		His resemblance, being not like the duke;
kingrichardiii@103261		Withal I did infer your lineaments,

kingrichardiii@103336		Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
kingrichardiii@103378		Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
kingrichardiii@103421		Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,

kingrichardiii@103723	
kingrichardiii@103724	GLOUCESTER	Ah! and did they so?
kingrichardiii@103756	
kingrichardiii@103757	BUCKINGHAM	No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
kingrichardiii@103811		But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
kingrichardiii@103856		Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
kingrichardiii@103902		Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
kingrichardiii@103941		And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
kingrichardiii@103994		His answer was, the people were not wont
kingrichardiii@104036		To be spoke to but by the recorder.
kingrichardiii@104073		Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
kingrichardiii@104115		'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
kingrichardiii@104168		But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
kingrichardiii@104212		When he had done, some followers of mine own,
kingrichardiii@104259		At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
kingrichardiii@104312		And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
kingrichardiii@104364		And thus I took the vantage of those few,
kingrichardiii@104407		'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
kingrichardiii@104456		'This general applause and loving shout
kingrichardiii@104497		Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'

kingrichardiii@105032		Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
kingrichardiii@105086

kingrichardiii@105597		He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
kingrichardiii@105645		Divinely bent to meditation;

kingrichardiii@105715		To draw him from his holy exercise.

kingrichardiii@106138		But on his knees at meditation;
kingrichardiii@106171		Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
kingrichardiii@106213		But meditating with two deep divines;
kingrichardiii@106252		Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
kingrichardiii@106293		But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
kingrichardiii@106336		Happy were England, would this gracious prince
kingrichardiii@106384		Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
kingrichardiii@106426		But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

kingrichardiii@106730		His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
kingrichardiii@106774		My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

kingrichardiii@107471		Lend favourable ears to our request;
kingrichardiii@107509		And pardon us the interruption
kingrichardiii@107541		Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
kingrichardiii@107584	
kingrichardiii@107585	GLOUCESTER	My lord, there needs no such apology:
kingrichardiii@107634		I rather do beseech you pardon me,
kingrichardiii@107670		Who, earnest in the service of my God,
kingrichardiii@107710		Neglect the visitation of my friends.
kingrichardiii@107749		But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

kingrichardiii@107901	GLOUCESTER	I do suspect I have done some offence
kingrichardiii@107950		That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,

kingrichardiii@108041	BUCKINGHAM	You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
kingrichardiii@108105		At our entreaties, to amend that fault!

kingrichardiii@108147	GLOUCESTER	Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
kingrichardiii@108204	
kingrichardiii@108205	BUCKINGHAM	Then know, it is your fault that you resign
kingrichardiii@108260		The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
kingrichardiii@108302		The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
kingrichardiii@108343		Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
kingrichardiii@108389		The lineal glory of your royal house,
kingrichardiii@108428		To the corruption of a blemished stock:
kingrichardiii@108469		Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
kingrichardiii@108519		Which here we waken to our country's good,
kingrichardiii@108563		This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
kingrichardiii@108608		Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
kingrichardiii@108648		Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
kingrichardiii@108692		And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
kingrichardiii@108738		Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
kingrichardiii@108781		Which to recure, we heartily solicit
kingrichardiii@108819		Your gracious self to take on you the charge
kingrichardiii@108865		And kingly government of this your land,
kingrichardiii@108907		Not as protector, steward, substitute,
kingrichardiii@108947		Or lowly factor for another's gain;
kingrichardiii@108984		But as successively from blood to blood,
kingrichardiii@109026		Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
kingrichardiii@109071		For this, consorted with the citizens,
kingrichardiii@109111		Your very worshipful and loving friends,
kingrichardiii@109153		And by their vehement instigation,
kingrichardiii@109189		In this just suit come I to move your grace.
kingrichardiii@109235	
kingrichardiii@109236	GLOUCESTER	I know not whether to depart in silence,
kingrichardiii@109288		Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
kingrichardiii@109327		Best fitteth my degree or your condition
kingrichardiii@109369		If not to answer, you might haply think
kingrichardiii@109410		Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
kingrichardiii@109455		To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
kingrichardiii@109496		Which fondly you would here impose on me;
kingrichardiii@109539		If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
kingrichardiii@109582		So season'd with your faithful love to me.
kingrichardiii@109626		Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
kingrichardiii@109675		Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
kingrichardiii@109721		And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
kingrichardiii@109768		Definitively thus I answer you.
kingrichardiii@109801		Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
kingrichardiii@109846		Unmeritable shuns your high request.
kingrichardiii@109884		First if all obstacles were cut away,
kingrichardiii@109923		And that my path were even to the crown,
kingrichardiii@109965		As my ripe revenue and due by birth
kingrichardiii@110002		Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
kingrichardiii@110040		So mighty and so many my defects,
kingrichardiii@110075		As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
kingrichardiii@110119		Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
kingrichardiii@110157		Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
kingrichardiii@110196		And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
kingrichardiii@110238		But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
kingrichardiii@110283		And much I need to help you, if need were;
kingrichardiii@110327		The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
kingrichardiii@110369		Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
kingrichardiii@110417		Will well become the seat of majesty,
kingrichardiii@110456		And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
kingrichardiii@110500		On him I lay what you would lay on me,
kingrichardiii@110540		The right and fortune of his happy stars;
kingrichardiii@110583		Which God defend that I should wring from him!
kingrichardiii@110631	
kingrichardiii@110632	BUCKINGHAM	My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
kingrichardiii@110690		But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
kingrichardiii@110738		All circumstances well considered.
kingrichardiii@110774		You say that Edward is your brother's son:
kingrichardiii@110818		So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
kingrichardiii@110860		For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
kingrichardiii@110902		Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
kingrichardiii@110945		And afterward by substitute betroth'd
kingrichardiii@110984		To Bona, sister to the King of France.
kingrichardiii@111024		These both put by a poor petitioner,
kingrichardiii@111062		A care-crazed mother of a many children,
kingrichardiii@111104		A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
kingrichardiii@111143		Even in the afternoon of her best days,
kingrichardiii@111184		Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
kingrichardiii@111229		Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
kingrichardiii@111279		To base declension and loathed bigamy
kingrichardiii@111318		By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
kingrichardiii@111355		This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
kingrichardiii@111403		More bitterly could I expostulate,
kingrichardiii@111439		Save that, for reverence to some alive,
kingrichardiii@111480		I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
kingrichardiii@111518		Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
kingrichardiii@111563		This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
kingrichardiii@111599		If non to bless us and the land withal,
kingrichardiii@111640		Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
kingrichardiii@111679		From the corruption of abusing times,
kingrichardiii@111718		Unto a lineal true-derived course.

kingrichardiii@112827

kingrichardiii@113310		Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
kingrichardiii@113354		From all the impure blots and stains thereof;

kingrichardiii@118099		Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
kingrichardiii@118143		Grossly grew captive to his honey words

kingrichardiii@118232		Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
kingrichardiii@118279		For never yet one hour in his bed
kingrichardiii@118314		Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
kingrichardiii@118355		But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
kingrichardiii@118400		Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
kingrichardiii@118445		And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

kingrichardiii@133633		And left thee but a very prey to time;
kingrichardiii@133673		Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
kingrichardiii@133720		To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
kingrichardiii@133768		Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
kingrichardiii@133814		Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
kingrichardiii@133855		Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
kingrichardiii@133905		From which even here I slip my weary neck,
kingrichardiii@133949		And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
kingrichardiii@133991		Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
kingrichardiii@134043		These English woes will make me smile in France.
kingrichardiii@134093	
kingrichardiii@134094	QUEEN ELIZABETH	O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
kingrichardiii@134154		And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
kingrichardiii@134195	
kingrichardiii@134196	QUEEN MARGARET	Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
kingrichardiii@134259		Compare dead happiness with living woe;
kingrichardiii@134300		Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
kingrichardiii@134350		And he that slew them fouler than he is:
kingrichardiii@134392		Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
kingrichardiii@134440		Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
kingrichardiii@134486	
kingrichardiii@134487	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
kingrichardiii@134550	
kingrichardiii@134551	QUEEN MARGARET	Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

kingrichardiii@134628	
kingrichardiii@134629	DUCHESS OF YORK	Why should calamity be full of words?
kingrichardiii@134683	
kingrichardiii@134684	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Windy attorneys to their client woes,
kingrichardiii@134738		Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
kingrichardiii@134774		Poor breathing orators of miseries!
kingrichardiii@134811		Let them have scope: though what they do impart
kingrichardiii@134860		Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
kingrichardiii@134903	
kingrichardiii@134904	DUCHESS OF YORK	If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
kingrichardiii@134964		And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
kingrichardiii@135013		My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
kingrichardiii@135065		I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
kingrichardiii@135107	
kingrichardiii@135108		[Enter KING RICHARD III, marching, with drums and trumpets]
kingrichardiii@135169	
kingrichardiii@135170	KING RICHARD III	Who intercepts my expedition?
kingrichardiii@135217	
kingrichardiii@135218	DUCHESS OF YORK	O, she that might have intercepted thee,
kingrichardiii@135275		By strangling thee in her accursed womb
kingrichardiii@135316		From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
kingrichardiii@135371	
kingrichardiii@135372	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
kingrichardiii@135435		Where should be graven, if that right were right,
kingrichardiii@135486		The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
kingrichardiii@135537		And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
kingrichardiii@135586		Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
kingrichardiii@135639	
kingrichardiii@135640	DUCHESS OF YORK	Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
kingrichardiii@135709		And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
kingrichardiii@135747	
kingrichardiii@135748	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
kingrichardiii@135811	
kingrichardiii@135812	KING RICHARD III	A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
kingrichardiii@135873		Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
kingrichardiii@135921		Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
kingrichardiii@135966	
kingrichardiii@135967		[Flourish. Alarums]
kingrichardiii@135988	
kingrichardiii@135989		Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
kingrichardiii@136030		Or with the clamorous report of war
kingrichardiii@136067		Thus will I drown your exclamations.
kingrichardiii@136105	
kingrichardiii@136106	DUCHESS OF YORK	Art thou my son?
kingrichardiii@136139	
kingrichardiii@136140	KING RICHARD III	Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
kingrichardiii@136199	
kingrichardiii@136200	DUCHESS OF YORK	Then patiently hear my impatience.
kingrichardiii@136251	
kingrichardiii@136252	KING RICHARD III	Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
kingrichardiii@136310		Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
kingrichardiii@136353	
kingrichardiii@136354	DUCHESS OF YORK	O, let me speak!
kingrichardiii@136387	
kingrichardiii@136388	KING RICHARD III	                  Do then: but I'll not hear.
kingrichardiii@136451	
kingrichardiii@136452	DUCHESS OF YORK	I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
kingrichardiii@136508	
kingrichardiii@136509	KING RICHARD III	And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
kingrichardiii@136569	
kingrichardiii@136570	DUCHESS OF YORK	Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
kingrichardiii@136629		God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
kingrichardiii@136669	
kingrichardiii@136670	KING RICHARD III	And came I not at last to comfort you?
kingrichardiii@136726	
kingrichardiii@136727	DUCHESS OF YORK	No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
kingrichardiii@136787		Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
kingrichardiii@136836		A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
kingrichardiii@136877		Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
kingrichardiii@136914		Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
kingrichardiii@136972		Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
kingrichardiii@137023		Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
kingrichardiii@137067		treacherous,
kingrichardiii@137081		More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
kingrichardiii@137131		What comfortable hour canst thou name,
kingrichardiii@137171		That ever graced me in thy company?
kingrichardiii@137208	
kingrichardiii@137209	KING RICHARD III	Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
kingrichardiii@137270		your grace
kingrichardiii@137282		To breakfast once forth of my company.
kingrichardiii@137322		If I be so disgracious in your sight,
kingrichardiii@137361		Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
kingrichardiii@137406		Strike the drum.
kingrichardiii@137424	
kingrichardiii@137425	DUCHESS OF YORK	                  I prithee, hear me speak.
kingrichardiii@137485	
kingrichardiii@137486	KING RICHARD III	You speak too bitterly.
kingrichardiii@137527	
kingrichardiii@137528	DUCHESS OF YORK	Hear me a word;
kingrichardiii@137560		For I shall never speak to thee again.
kingrichardiii@137600	
kingrichardiii@137601	KING RICHARD III	So.
kingrichardiii@137622	
kingrichardiii@137623	DUCHESS OF YORK	Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
kingrichardiii@137686		Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
kingrichardiii@137728		Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
kingrichardiii@137774		And never look upon thy face again.
kingrichardiii@137811		Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
kingrichardiii@137858		Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
kingrichardiii@137903		Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
kingrichardiii@137952		My prayers on the adverse party fight;
kingrichardiii@137992		And there the little souls of Edward's children
kingrichardiii@138041		Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
kingrichardiii@138079		And promise them success and victory.
kingrichardiii@138118		Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
kingrichardiii@138160		Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
kingrichardiii@138210	
kingrichardiii@138211		[Exit]
kingrichardiii@138219	
kingrichardiii@138220	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
kingrichardiii@138289		Abides in me; I say amen to all.
kingrichardiii@138323	
kingrichardiii@138324	KING RICHARD III	Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
kingrichardiii@138384	
kingrichardiii@138385	QUEEN ELIZABETH	I have no more sons of the royal blood
kingrichardiii@138440		For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
kingrichardiii@138488		They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
kingrichardiii@138537		And therefore level not to hit their lives.
kingrichardiii@138582	
kingrichardiii@138583	KING RICHARD III	You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
kingrichardiii@138638		Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
kingrichardiii@138678	
kingrichardiii@138679	QUEEN ELIZABETH	And must she die for this? O, let her live,
kingrichardiii@138739		And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
kingrichardiii@138788		Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
kingrichardiii@138830		Throw over her the veil of infamy:
kingrichardiii@138866		So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
kingrichardiii@138916		I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
kingrichardiii@138963	
kingrichardiii@138964	KING RICHARD III	Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
kingrichardiii@139025	
kingrichardiii@139026	QUEEN ELIZABETH	To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
kingrichardiii@139084	
kingrichardiii@139085	KING RICHARD III	Her life is only safest in her birth.
kingrichardiii@139140	
kingrichardiii@139141	QUEEN ELIZABETH	And only in that safety died her brothers.
kingrichardiii@139200	
kingrichardiii@139201	KING RICHARD III	Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
kingrichardiii@139264	
kingrichardiii@139265	QUEEN ELIZABETH	No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
kingrichardiii@139327	
kingrichardiii@139328	KING RICHARD III	All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
kingrichardiii@139383	
kingrichardiii@139384	QUEEN ELIZABETH	True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
kingrichardiii@139440		My babes were destined to a fairer death,
kingrichardiii@139483		If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
kingrichardiii@139530	
kingrichardiii@139531	KING RICHARD III	You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
kingrichardiii@139593	
kingrichardiii@139594	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
kingrichardiii@139654		Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
kingrichardiii@139700		Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
kingrichardiii@139747		Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
kingrichardiii@139790		No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
kingrichardiii@139839		Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
kingrichardiii@139885		To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
kingrichardiii@139924		But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
kingrichardiii@139976		My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
kingrichardiii@140023		Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
kingrichardiii@140072		And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
kingrichardiii@140114		Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
kingrichardiii@140161		Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
kingrichardiii@140201	
kingrichardiii@140202	KING RICHARD III	Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
kingrichardiii@140255		And dangerous success of bloody wars,
kingrichardiii@140294		As I intend more good to you and yours,
kingrichardiii@140335		Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
kingrichardiii@140379	
kingrichardiii@140380	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
kingrichardiii@140442		To be discover'd, that can do me good?
kingrichardiii@140482	
kingrichardiii@140483	KING RICHARD III	The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
kingrichardiii@140547	
kingrichardiii@140548	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
kingrichardiii@140612	
kingrichardiii@140613	KING RICHARD III	No, to the dignity and height of honour
kingrichardiii@140670		The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
kingrichardiii@140717	
kingrichardiii@140718	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
kingrichardiii@140772		Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
kingrichardiii@140820		Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
kingrichardiii@140861	
kingrichardiii@140862	KING RICHARD III	Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
kingrichardiii@140921		Will I withal endow a child of thine;
kingrichardiii@140960		So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
kingrichardiii@140995		Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
kingrichardiii@141043		Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
kingrichardiii@141086	
kingrichardiii@141087	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
kingrichardiii@141150		Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
kingrichardiii@141196	
kingrichardiii@141197	KING RICHARD III	Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
kingrichardiii@141264	
kingrichardiii@141265	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
kingrichardiii@141327	
kingrichardiii@141328	KING RICHARD III	What do you think?
kingrichardiii@141364	
kingrichardiii@141365	QUEEN ELIZABETH	That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
kingrichardiii@141428		So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
kingrichardiii@141483		And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
kingrichardiii@141533	
kingrichardiii@141534	KING RICHARD III	Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
kingrichardiii@141591		I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
kingrichardiii@141639		And mean to make her queen of England.
kingrichardiii@141679	
kingrichardiii@141680	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
kingrichardiii@141744	
kingrichardiii@141745	KING RICHARD III	Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
kingrichardiii@141811	
kingrichardiii@141812	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What, thou?
kingrichardiii@141840	
kingrichardiii@141841	KING RICHARD III	I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
kingrichardiii@141898	
kingrichardiii@141899	QUEEN ELIZABETH	How canst thou woo her?
kingrichardiii@141939	
kingrichardiii@141940	KING RICHARD III	That would I learn of you,
kingrichardiii@141984		As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
kingrichardiii@142034	
kingrichardiii@142035	QUEEN ELIZABETH	And wilt thou learn of me?
kingrichardiii@142078	
kingrichardiii@142079	KING RICHARD III	Madam, with all my heart.
kingrichardiii@142122	
kingrichardiii@142123	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
kingrichardiii@142187		A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
kingrichardiii@142231		Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
kingrichardiii@142275		Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
kingrichardiii@142323		Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
kingrichardiii@142373		A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
kingrichardiii@142419		The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
kingrichardiii@142465		And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
kingrichardiii@142510		If this inducement force her not to love,
kingrichardiii@142553		Send her a story of thy noble acts;
kingrichardiii@142590		Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
kingrichardiii@142637		Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
kingrichardiii@142680		Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
kingrichardiii@142730	
kingrichardiii@142731	KING RICHARD III	Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
kingrichardiii@142793		To win our daughter.
kingrichardiii@142815	
kingrichardiii@142816	QUEEN ELIZABETH	There is no other way
kingrichardiii@142854		Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
kingrichardiii@142900		And not be Richard that hath done all this.
kingrichardiii@142945	
kingrichardiii@142946	KING RICHARD III	Say that I did all this for love of her.
kingrichardiii@143004	
kingrichardiii@143005	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
kingrichardiii@143071		Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
kingrichardiii@143117	
kingrichardiii@143118	KING RICHARD III	Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
kingrichardiii@143177		Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
kingrichardiii@143216		Which after hours give leisure to repent.
kingrichardiii@143259		If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
kingrichardiii@143302		To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
kingrichardiii@143349		If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
kingrichardiii@143391		To quicken your increase, I will beget
kingrichardiii@143431		Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
kingrichardiii@143476		A grandam's name is little less in love
kingrichardiii@143517		Than is the doting title of a mother;
kingrichardiii@143556		They are as children but one step below,
kingrichardiii@143598		Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
kingrichardiii@143640		Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
kingrichardiii@143684		Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
kingrichardiii@143731		Your children were vexation to your youth,
kingrichardiii@143775		But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
kingrichardiii@143817		The loss you have is but a son being king,
kingrichardiii@143861		And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
kingrichardiii@143908		I cannot make you what amends I would,
kingrichardiii@143948		Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
kingrichardiii@143990		Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
kingrichardiii@144033		Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
kingrichardiii@144076		This fair alliance quickly shall call home
kingrichardiii@144120		To high promotions and great dignity:
kingrichardiii@144159		The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
kingrichardiii@144211		Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
kingrichardiii@144254		Again shall you be mother to a king,
kingrichardiii@144292		And all the ruins of distressful times
kingrichardiii@144332		Repair'd with double riches of content.
kingrichardiii@144373		What! we have many goodly days to see:
kingrichardiii@144413		The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
kingrichardiii@144459		Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
kingrichardiii@144507		Advantaging their loan with interest
kingrichardiii@144545		Of ten times double gain of happiness.
kingrichardiii@144585		Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
kingrichardiii@144625		Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
kingrichardiii@144676		Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
kingrichardiii@144717		Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
kingrichardiii@144761		Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
kingrichardiii@144807		With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
kingrichardiii@144853		And when this arm of mine hath chastised
kingrichardiii@144895		The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
kingrichardiii@144938		Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
kingrichardiii@144982		And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
kingrichardiii@145027		To whom I will retail my conquest won,
kingrichardiii@145067		And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
kingrichardiii@145117	
kingrichardiii@145118	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What were I best to say? her father's brother
kingrichardiii@145180		Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
kingrichardiii@145227		Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
kingrichardiii@145274		Under what title shall I woo for thee,
kingrichardiii@145314		That God, the law, my honour and her love,
kingrichardiii@145358		Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
kingrichardiii@145403	
kingrichardiii@145404	KING RICHARD III	Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
kingrichardiii@145466	
kingrichardiii@145467	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
kingrichardiii@145532	
kingrichardiii@145533	KING RICHARD III	Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
kingrichardiii@145598	
kingrichardiii@145599	QUEEN ELIZABETH	That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
kingrichardiii@145664	
kingrichardiii@145665	KING RICHARD III	Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
kingrichardiii@145725	
kingrichardiii@145726	QUEEN ELIZABETH	To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
kingrichardiii@145780	
kingrichardiii@145781	KING RICHARD III	Say, I will love her everlastingly.
kingrichardiii@145834	
kingrichardiii@145835	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
kingrichardiii@145894	
kingrichardiii@145895	KING RICHARD III	Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
kingrichardiii@145955

kingrichardiii@146931

kingrichardiii@146959	
kingrichardiii@146960	QUEEN ELIZABETH	        By nothing; for this is no oath:
kingrichardiii@147017		The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
kingrichardiii@147067		The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
kingrichardiii@147119		The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
kingrichardiii@147168		if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
kingrichardiii@147214		Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
kingrichardiii@147267

kingrichardiii@147683		The unity the king thy brother made
kingrichardiii@147720		Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:

kingrichardiii@147811		The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
kingrichardiii@147855		Had graced the tender temples of my child,

kingrichardiii@147946		Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
kingrichardiii@147990		Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.

kingrichardiii@148068	KING RICHARD III	The time to come.
kingrichardiii@148103

kingrichardiii@148251		The children live, whose parents thou hast
kingrichardiii@148295		slaughter'd,

kingrichardiii@148408		Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
kingrichardiii@148457		Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
kingrichardiii@148504		Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
kingrichardiii@148549	
kingrichardiii@148550	KING RICHARD III	As I intend to prosper and repent,
kingrichardiii@148602		So thrive I in my dangerous attempt

kingrichardiii@148943		In her consists my happiness and thine;
kingrichardiii@148984		Without her, follows to this land and me,
kingrichardiii@149027		To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
kingrichardiii@149073		Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
kingrichardiii@149109		It cannot be avoided but by this;
kingrichardiii@149144		It will not be avoided but by this.
kingrichardiii@149181		Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
kingrichardiii@149227		Be the attorney of my love to her:
kingrichardiii@149263		Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
kingrichardiii@149308		Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
kingrichardiii@149350		Urge the necessity and state of times,
kingrichardiii@149390		And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
kingrichardiii@149433	
kingrichardiii@149434	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

kingrichardiii@157795		And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
kingrichardiii@157840		Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
kingrichardiii@157885		To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
kingrichardiii@157937		Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;

kingrichardiii@167678		Let us be led within thy bosom, Richard,
kingrichardiii@167720		And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
kingrichardiii@167768		Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die!
kingrichardiii@167814	
kingrichardiii@167815		[To RICHMOND]
kingrichardiii@167830	
kingrichardiii@167831		Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;
kingrichardiii@167882		Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
kingrichardiii@167929		Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
kingrichardiii@167969		Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

kingrichardiii@168048	Ghost of LADY ANNE	[To KING RICHARD III]
kingrichardiii@168089	
kingrichardiii@168090		Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
kingrichardiii@168139		That never slept a quiet hour with thee,
kingrichardiii@168181		Now fills thy sleep with perturbations
kingrichardiii@168221		To-morrow in the battle think on me,
kingrichardiii@168259		And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!

kingrichardiii@168487	of BUCKINGHAM	[To KING RICHARD III]
kingrichardiii@168523	
kingrichardiii@168524		The last was I that helped thee to the crown;
kingrichardiii@168571		The last was I that felt thy tyranny:
kingrichardiii@168610		O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
kingrichardiii@168649		And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
kingrichardiii@168687		Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:
kingrichardiii@168735		Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!

kingrichardiii@168786		[To RICHMOND]
kingrichardiii@168801	
kingrichardiii@168802		I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:
kingrichardiii@168846		But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:
kingrichardiii@168894		God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;
kingrichardiii@168940		And Richard falls in height of all his pride.

kingrichardiii@169114		Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
kingrichardiii@169157		O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
kingrichardiii@169205		The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
kingrichardiii@169253		Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
kingrichardiii@169302		What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
kingrichardiii@169351		Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
kingrichardiii@169392		Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
kingrichardiii@169435		Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
kingrichardiii@169485		Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
kingrichardiii@169528		Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
kingrichardiii@169576		That I myself have done unto myself?
kingrichardiii@169614		O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
kingrichardiii@169649		For hateful deeds committed by myself!
kingrichardiii@169689		I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
kingrichardiii@169727		Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
kingrichardiii@169779		My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
kingrichardiii@169827		And every tongue brings in a several tale,
kingrichardiii@169871		And every tale condemns me for a villain.
kingrichardiii@169914		Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
kingrichardiii@169955		Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
kingrichardiii@169999		All several sins, all used in each degree,
kingrichardiii@170043		Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
kingrichardiii@170091		I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
kingrichardiii@170140		And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
kingrichardiii@170178		Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
kingrichardiii@170227		Find in myself no pity to myself?
kingrichardiii@170262		Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
kingrichardiii@170310		Came to my tent; and every one did threat
kingrichardiii@170353		To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

kingrichardiii@170539		Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
kingrichardiii@170580		Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
kingrichardiii@170630	
kingrichardiii@170631	KING RICHARD III	O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
kingrichardiii@170692		What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
kingrichardiii@170746	
kingrichardiii@170747	RATCLIFF	No doubt, my lord.

kingrichardiii@170776	KING RICHARD III	                  O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
kingrichardiii@170841	
kingrichardiii@170842	RATCLIFF	Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
kingrichardiii@170896	
kingrichardiii@170897	KING RICHARD III	By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
kingrichardiii@170952		Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
kingrichardiii@171000		Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
kingrichardiii@171049		Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
kingrichardiii@171095		It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
kingrichardiii@171138		Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
kingrichardiii@171184		To see if any mean to shrink from me.

kingrichardiii@171413	LORDS	How have you slept, my lord?
kingrichardiii@171448	
kingrichardiii@171449	RICHMOND	The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
kingrichardiii@171504		That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
kingrichardiii@171541		Have I since your departure had, my lords.
kingrichardiii@171585		Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
kingrichardiii@171640		Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
kingrichardiii@171680		I promise you, my soul is very jocund
kingrichardiii@171719		In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
kingrichardiii@171759		How far into the morning is it, lords?
kingrichardiii@171799	
kingrichardiii@171800	LORDS	Upon the stroke of four.
kingrichardiii@171831

kingrichardiii@171889		[His oration to his soldiers]
kingrichardiii@171920

kingrichardiii@171964		The leisure and enforcement of the time
kingrichardiii@172005		Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
kingrichardiii@172048		God and our good cause fight upon our side;
kingrichardiii@172093		The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
kingrichardiii@172140		Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
kingrichardiii@172192		Richard except, those whom we fight against
kingrichardiii@172237		Had rather have us win than him they follow:
kingrichardiii@172283		For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
kingrichardiii@172331		A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
kingrichardiii@172364		One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
kingrichardiii@172416		One that made means to come by what he hath,
kingrichardiii@172462		And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
kingrichardiii@172518		Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
kingrichardiii@172563		Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
kingrichardiii@172609		One that hath ever been God's enemy:
kingrichardiii@172647		Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
kingrichardiii@172688		God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
kingrichardiii@172735		If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
kingrichardiii@172774		You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
kingrichardiii@172819		If you do fight against your country's foes,
kingrichardiii@172865		Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
kingrichardiii@172916		If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
kingrichardiii@172961		Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
kingrichardiii@173008		If you do free your children from the sword,
kingrichardiii@173054		Your children's children quit it in your age.
kingrichardiii@173101		Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
kingrichardiii@173149		Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
kingrichardiii@173200		For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
kingrichardiii@173239		Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
kingrichardiii@173292		But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
kingrichardiii@173333		The least of you shall share his part thereof.

kingrichardiii@173612	RATCLIFF	That he was never trained up in arms.
kingrichardiii@173659

kingrichardiii@173723	
kingrichardiii@173724	RATCLIFF	He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'

kingrichardiii@174898		They thus directed, we will follow
kingrichardiii@174934		In the main battle, whose puissance on either side

kingrichardiii@175033		This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?

kingrichardiii@175876		Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
kingrichardiii@175921		To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
kingrichardiii@175969		You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
kingrichardiii@176015		You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
kingrichardiii@176066		They would restrain the one, distain the other.
kingrichardiii@176115		And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
kingrichardiii@176160		Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
kingrichardiii@176205		A milk-sop, one that never in his life
kingrichardiii@176245		Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?

kingrichardiii@176337		Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
kingrichardiii@176383		These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
kingrichardiii@176430		Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
kingrichardiii@176475		For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
kingrichardiii@176529		If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
kingrichardiii@176570		And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
kingrichardiii@176619		Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
kingrichardiii@176672		And in record, left them the heirs of shame.

kingrichardiii@178914	
kingrichardiii@178915	RICHMOND	Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
kingrichardiii@178962		But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
kingrichardiii@179009	
kingrichardiii@179010	DERBY	He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
kingrichardiii@179060		Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
kingrichardiii@179112	
kingrichardiii@179113	RICHMOND	What men of name are slain on either side?
kingrichardiii@179165	
kingrichardiii@179166	DERBY	John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
kingrichardiii@179215		Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
kingrichardiii@179264	
kingrichardiii@179265	RICHMOND	Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
kingrichardiii@179318		Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
kingrichardiii@179358		That in submission will return to us:
kingrichardiii@179397		And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
kingrichardiii@179440		We will unite the white rose and the red:
kingrichardiii@179483		Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
kingrichardiii@179525		That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
kingrichardiii@179568		What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
kingrichardiii@179611		England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
kingrichardiii@179661		The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
kingrichardiii@179708		The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
kingrichardiii@179752		The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
kingrichardiii@179799		All this divided York and Lancaster,
kingrichardiii@179837		Divided in their dire division,
kingrichardiii@179870		O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
kingrichardiii@179907		The true succeeders of each royal house,
kingrichardiii@179949		By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
kingrichardiii@179992		And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
kingrichardiii@180038		Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
kingrichardiii@180088		With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
kingrichardiii@180135		Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
kingrichardiii@180179		That would reduce these bloody days again,
kingrichardiii@180223		And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
kingrichardiii@180272		Let them not live to taste this land's increase
kingrichardiii@180321		That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
kingrichardiii@180376		Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
kingrichardiii@180426		That she may long live here, God say amen!

coriolanus@1559	
coriolanus@1560	
coriolanus@1561		[Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves,
coriolanus@1614		clubs, and other weapons]
coriolanus@1641	
coriolanus@1642	First Citizen	Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
coriolanus@1702	
coriolanus@1703	All	Speak, speak.
coriolanus@1721	
coriolanus@1722	First Citizen	You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
coriolanus@1787	
coriolanus@1788	All	Resolved. resolved.
coriolanus@1812	
coriolanus@1813	First Citizen	First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
coriolanus@1887	
coriolanus@1888	All	We know't, we know't.
coriolanus@1914	
coriolanus@1915	First Citizen	Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
coriolanus@1984		Is't a verdict?
coriolanus@2001	
coriolanus@2002	All	No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
coriolanus@2056	
coriolanus@2057	Second Citizen	One word, good citizens.
coriolanus@2097	
coriolanus@2098	First Citizen	We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
coriolanus@2165		What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
coriolanus@2219		would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
coriolanus@2270		wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
coriolanus@2324		but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
coriolanus@2375		afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
coriolanus@2424		inventory to particularise their abundance; our
coriolanus@2473		sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
coriolanus@2528		our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
coriolanus@2581		speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
coriolanus@2641	
coriolanus@2642	Second Citizen	Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
coriolanus@2709	
coriolanus@2710	All	Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
coriolanus@2768	
coriolanus@2769	Second Citizen	Consider you what services he has done for his country?
coriolanus@2840	
coriolanus@2841	First Citizen	Very well; and could be content to give him good
coriolanus@2904		report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
coriolanus@2961	
coriolanus@2962	Second Citizen	Nay, but speak not maliciously.
coriolanus@3009	
coriolanus@3010	First Citizen	I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
coriolanus@3075		it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
coriolanus@3127		content to say it was for his country he did it to
coriolanus@3179		please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
coriolanus@3231		is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
coriolanus@3274	
coriolanus@3275	Second Citizen	What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
coriolanus@3339		vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
coriolanus@3392	
coriolanus@3393	First Citizen	If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
coriolanus@3459		he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
coriolanus@3513	
coriolanus@3514		[Shouts within]
coriolanus@3531	
coriolanus@3532		What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
coriolanus@3583		is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
coriolanus@3636	
coriolanus@3637	All	Come, come.
coriolanus@3653	
coriolanus@3654	First Citizen	Soft! who comes here?
coriolanus@3690	
coriolanus@3691		[Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA]
coriolanus@3717	
coriolanus@3718	Second Citizen	Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
coriolanus@3785		the people.
coriolanus@3798	
coriolanus@3799	First Citizen	He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
coriolanus@3865	
coriolanus@3866	MENENIUS	What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
coriolanus@3925		With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
coriolanus@3978	
coriolanus@3979	First Citizen	Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
coriolanus@4046		had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
coriolanus@4096		which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
coriolanus@4146		suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
coriolanus@4195		have strong arms too.
coriolanus@4218	
coriolanus@4219	MENENIUS	Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
coriolanus@4283		Will you undo yourselves?
coriolanus@4310	
coriolanus@4311	First Citizen	We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
coriolanus@4364	
coriolanus@4365	MENENIUS	I tell you, friends, most charitable care
coriolanus@4416		Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
coriolanus@4461		Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
coriolanus@4509		Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
coriolanus@4561		Against the Roman state, whose course will on
coriolanus@4608		The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
coriolanus@4655		Of more strong link asunder than can ever
coriolanus@4698		Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
coriolanus@4742		The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
coriolanus@4786		Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
coriolanus@4835		You are transported by calamity
coriolanus@4868		Thither where more attends you, and you slander
coriolanus@4917		The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
coriolanus@4973		When you curse them as enemies.
coriolanus@5006	
coriolanus@5007	First Citizen	Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
coriolanus@5072		yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
coriolanus@5122		crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
coriolanus@5169		support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
coriolanus@5218		established against the rich, and provide more
coriolanus@5266		piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
coriolanus@5317		the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
coriolanus@5370		there's all the love they bear us.
coriolanus@5406	
coriolanus@5407	MENENIUS	Either you must
coriolanus@5432		Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
coriolanus@5472		Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
coriolanus@5514		A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
coriolanus@5559		But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
coriolanus@5608		To stale 't a little more.
coriolanus@5636	
coriolanus@5637	First Citizen	Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
coriolanus@5702		fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
coriolanus@5755		you, deliver.
coriolanus@5770	
coriolanus@5771	MENENIUS	There was a time when all the body's members
coriolanus@5825		Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
coriolanus@5871		That only like a gulf it did remain
coriolanus@5908		I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
coriolanus@5954		Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
coriolanus@5998		Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
coriolanus@6054		Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
coriolanus@6103		And, mutually participate, did minister
coriolanus@6144		Unto the appetite and affection common
coriolanus@6184		Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
coriolanus@6225	
coriolanus@6226	First Citizen	Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
coriolanus@6279	
coriolanus@6280	MENENIUS	Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
coriolanus@6334		Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
coriolanus@6384		For, look you, I may make the belly smile
coriolanus@6427		As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
coriolanus@6468		To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
coriolanus@6517		That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
coriolanus@6562		As you malign our senators for that
coriolanus@6599		They are not such as you.
coriolanus@6626	
coriolanus@6627	First Citizen	Your belly's answer? What!
coriolanus@6668		The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
coriolanus@6712		The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
coriolanus@6756		Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
coriolanus@6802		With other muniments and petty helps
coriolanus@6840		In this our fabric, if that they--
coriolanus@6876	
coriolanus@6877	MENENIUS	What then?
coriolanus@6897		'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
coriolanus@6950	
coriolanus@6951	First Citizen	Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
coriolanus@7010		Who is the sink o' the body,--
coriolanus@7042	
coriolanus@7043	MENENIUS	Well, what then?
coriolanus@7069	
coriolanus@7070	First Citizen	The former agents, if they did complain,
coriolanus@7125		What could the belly answer?
coriolanus@7155	
coriolanus@7156	MENENIUS	I will tell you
coriolanus@7181		If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
coriolanus@7234		Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
coriolanus@7284	
coriolanus@7285	First Citizen	Ye're long about it.
coriolanus@7320	
coriolanus@7321	MENENIUS	Note me this, good friend;
coriolanus@7357		Your most grave belly was deliberate,
coriolanus@7396		Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
coriolanus@7444		'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
coriolanus@7493		'That I receive the general food at first,
coriolanus@7537		Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
coriolanus@7577		Because I am the store-house and the shop
coriolanus@7620		Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
coriolanus@7665		I send it through the rivers of your blood,
coriolanus@7710		Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
coriolanus@7767		And, through the cranks and offices of man,
coriolanus@7812		The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
coriolanus@7859		From me receive that natural competency
coriolanus@7900		Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
coriolanus@7949		You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
coriolanus@8006	
coriolanus@8007	First Citizen	Ay, sir; well, well.
coriolanus@8042	
coriolanus@8043	MENENIUS	'Though all at once cannot
coriolanus@8079		See what I do deliver out to each,
coriolanus@8115		Yet I can make my audit up, that all
coriolanus@8153		From me do back receive the flour of all,
coriolanus@8196		And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
coriolanus@8244	
coriolanus@8245	First Citizen	It was an answer: how apply you this?
coriolanus@8297	
coriolanus@8298	MENENIUS	The senators of Rome are this good belly,
coriolanus@8349		And you the mutinous members; for examine
coriolanus@8392		Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
coriolanus@8447		Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
coriolanus@8496		No public benefit which you receive
coriolanus@8533		But it proceeds or comes from them to you
coriolanus@8576		And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
coriolanus@8624		You, the great toe of this assembly?
coriolanus@8662	
coriolanus@8663	First Citizen	I the great toe! why the great toe?
coriolanus@8713	
coriolanus@8714	MENENIUS	For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
coriolanus@8775		Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
coriolanus@8826		Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
coriolanus@8872		Lead'st first to win some vantage.
coriolanus@8908		But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
coriolanus@8955		Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
coriolanus@9002		The one side must have bale.
coriolanus@9032	
coriolanus@9033		[Enter CAIUS MARCIUS]
coriolanus@9056	
coriolanus@9057			       Hail, noble Marcius!
coriolanus@9087	
coriolanus@9088	MARCIUS	Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
coriolanus@9147		That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
coriolanus@9193		Make yourselves scabs?
coriolanus@9217	
coriolanus@9218	First Citizen	We have ever your good word.
coriolanus@9261	
coriolanus@9262	MARCIUS	He that will give good words to thee will flatter
coriolanus@9320		Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
coriolanus@9371		That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
coriolanus@9424		The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
coriolanus@9475		Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
coriolanus@9525		Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
coriolanus@9568		Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
coriolanus@9608		Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
coriolanus@9649		To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
coriolanus@9695		And curse that justice did it.
coriolanus@9727		Who deserves greatness
coriolanus@9751		Deserves your hate; and your affections are
coriolanus@9796		A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
coriolanus@9842		Which would increase his evil. He that depends
coriolanus@9890		Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
coriolanus@9933		And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
coriolanus@9985		With every minute you do change a mind,
coriolanus@10026		And call him noble that was now your hate,
coriolanus@10070		Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
coriolanus@10122		That in these several places of the city
coriolanus@10164		You cry against the noble senate, who,
coriolanus@10204		Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
coriolanus@10249		Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
coriolanus@10299	
coriolanus@10300	MENENIUS	For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
coriolanus@10357		The city is well stored.
coriolanus@10383	
coriolanus@10384	MARCIUS	Hang 'em! They say!
coriolanus@10412		They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
coriolanus@10458		What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
coriolanus@10507		Who thrives and who declines; side factions
coriolanus@10552		and give out
coriolanus@10566		Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
coriolanus@10612		And feebling such as stand not in their liking
coriolanus@10660		Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
coriolanus@10705		grain enough!
coriolanus@10720		Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
coriolanus@10762		And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
coriolanus@10807		With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
coriolanus@10858		As I could pick my lance.
coriolanus@10885	
coriolanus@10886	MENENIUS	Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
coriolanus@10939		For though abundantly they lack discretion,
coriolanus@10984		Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
coriolanus@11036		What says the other troop?
coriolanus@11064	
coriolanus@11065	MARCIUS	They are dissolved: hang 'em!
coriolanus@11103		They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
coriolanus@11158		That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
coriolanus@11210		That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
coriolanus@11265		Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
coriolanus@11312		They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
coriolanus@11367		And a petition granted them, a strange one--
coriolanus@11413		To break the heart of generosity,
coriolanus@11448		And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
coriolanus@11502		As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
coriolanus@11553		Shouting their emulation.
coriolanus@11580	
coriolanus@11581	MENENIUS	What is granted them?
coriolanus@11612	
coriolanus@11613	MARCIUS	Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
coriolanus@11667		Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
coriolanus@11710		Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
coriolanus@11754		The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
coriolanus@11803		Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
coriolanus@11846		Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
coriolanus@11893		For insurrection's arguing.
coriolanus@11922	
coriolanus@11923	MENENIUS	This is strange.
coriolanus@11949	
coriolanus@11950	MARCIUS	Go, get you home, you fragments!

coriolanus@12023	Messenger	Where's Caius Marcius?
coriolanus@12056	
coriolanus@12057	MARCIUS	Here: what's the matter?
coriolanus@12090	
coriolanus@12091	Messenger	The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
coriolanus@12144	
coriolanus@12145	MARCIUS	I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
coriolanus@12202		Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
coriolanus@12248	
coriolanus@12249		[Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators;
coriolanus@12302		JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS]
coriolanus@12339	
coriolanus@12340	First Senator	Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
coriolanus@12403		The Volsces are in arms.
coriolanus@12429	
coriolanus@12430	MARCIUS	They have a leader,
coriolanus@12458		Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
coriolanus@12501		I sin in envying his nobility,
coriolanus@12533		And were I any thing but what I am,
coriolanus@12570		I would wish me only he.
coriolanus@12596	
coriolanus@12597	COMINIUS	You have fought together.
coriolanus@12632	
coriolanus@12633	MARCIUS	Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
coriolanus@12689		Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
coriolanus@12725		Only my wars with him: he is a lion
coriolanus@12762		That I am proud to hunt.
coriolanus@12788	
coriolanus@12789	First Senator	Then, worthy Marcius,
coriolanus@12825		Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
coriolanus@12862	
coriolanus@12863	COMINIUS	It is your former promise.
coriolanus@12899	
coriolanus@12900	MARCIUS	Sir, it is;
coriolanus@12920		And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
coriolanus@12960		Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
coriolanus@13008		What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
coriolanus@13045	
coriolanus@13046	TITUS	No, Caius Marcius;
coriolanus@13071		I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
coriolanus@13122		Ere stay behind this business.
coriolanus@13154	
coriolanus@13155	MENENIUS	O, true-bred!
coriolanus@13178	
coriolanus@13179	First Senator	Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
coriolanus@13237		Our greatest friends attend us.
coriolanus@13270	
coriolanus@13271	TITUS	[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.
coriolanus@13319	
coriolanus@13320		[To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;
coriolanus@13372		Right worthy you priority.
coriolanus@13400	
coriolanus@13401	COMINIUS	Noble Marcius!
coriolanus@13425	
coriolanus@13426	First Senator	[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone!
coriolanus@13489	
coriolanus@13490	MARCIUS	Nay, let them follow:
coriolanus@13520		The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
coriolanus@13573		To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
coriolanus@13618		Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
coriolanus@13662	
coriolanus@13663		[Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS
coriolanus@13710		and BRUTUS]
coriolanus@13723	
coriolanus@13724	SICINIUS	Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
coriolanus@13775	
coriolanus@13776	BRUTUS	He has no equal.
coriolanus@13800	
coriolanus@13801	SICINIUS	When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
coriolanus@13857	
coriolanus@13858	BRUTUS	Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
coriolanus@13894	
coriolanus@13895	SICINIUS	Nay. but his taunts.
coriolanus@13925	
coriolanus@13926	BRUTUS	Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
coriolanus@13982	
coriolanus@13983	SICINIUS	Be-mock the modest moon.
coriolanus@14017	
coriolanus@14018	BRUTUS	The present wars devour him: he is grown
coriolanus@14066		Too proud to be so valiant.
coriolanus@14095	
coriolanus@14096	SICINIUS	Such a nature,
coriolanus@14120		Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
coriolanus@14168		Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
coriolanus@14213		His insolence can brook to be commanded
coriolanus@14254		Under Cominius.
coriolanus@14271	
coriolanus@14272	BRUTUS	Fame, at the which he aims,
coriolanus@14307		In whom already he's well graced, can not
coriolanus@14350		Better be held nor more attain'd than by
coriolanus@14392		A place below the first: for what miscarries
coriolanus@14438		Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
coriolanus@14487		To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
coriolanus@14530		Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
coriolanus@14569		Had borne the business!'
coriolanus@14595	
coriolanus@14596	SICINIUS	Besides, if things go well,
coriolanus@14633		Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
coriolanus@14674		Of his demerits rob Cominius.
coriolanus@14705	
coriolanus@14706	BRUTUS	Come:
coriolanus@14719		Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
coriolanus@14763		Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
coriolanus@14815		To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
coriolanus@14859		In aught he merit not.
coriolanus@14883	
coriolanus@14884	SICINIUS	Let's hence, and hear
coriolanus@14915		How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
coriolanus@14963		More than his singularity, he goes
coriolanus@14999		Upon this present action.

coriolanus@16032	AUFIDIUS	                  Nor did you think it folly

coriolanus@17110		on two low stools, and sew]
coriolanus@17139	
coriolanus@17140	VOLUMNIA	I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
coriolanus@17202		more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
coriolanus@17255		should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
coriolanus@17307		won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
coriolanus@17361		he would show most love. When yet he was but
coriolanus@17407		tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
coriolanus@17456		youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
coriolanus@17510		for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
coriolanus@17562		sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
coriolanus@17615		how honour would become such a person. that it was
coriolanus@17667		no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
coriolanus@17720		renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
coriolanus@17774		danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
coriolanus@17825		war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
coriolanus@17877		bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
coriolanus@17930		more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
coriolanus@17979		than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
coriolanus@18029		man.
coriolanus@18035	
coriolanus@18036	VIRGILIA	But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
coriolanus@18095	
coriolanus@18096	VOLUMNIA	Then his good report should have been my son; I
coriolanus@18153		therein would have found issue. Hear me profess

coriolanus@18250		alike and none less dear than thine and my good
coriolanus@18299		Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
coriolanus@18353		country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

coriolanus@18545	
coriolanus@18546	VOLUMNIA	Indeed, you shall not.
coriolanus@18578		Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
coriolanus@18623		See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
coriolanus@18665		As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
coriolanus@18717		Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
coriolanus@18764		'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
coriolanus@18810		Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
coriolanus@18858		With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
coriolanus@18908		Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
coriolanus@18952		Or all or lose his hire.
coriolanus@18978	
coriolanus@18979	VIRGILIA	His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
coriolanus@19026	
coriolanus@19027	VOLUMNIA	Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
coriolanus@19074		Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
coriolanus@19120		When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
coriolanus@19169		Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood

coriolanus@19884	
coriolanus@19885	VALERIA	O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
coriolanus@19941		very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
coriolanus@19993		Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
coriolanus@20038		confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
coriolanus@20091		butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
coriolanus@20139		again; and after it again; and over and over he
coriolanus@20188		comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
coriolanus@20240		fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
coriolanus@20291		teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
coriolanus@20345		it!
coriolanus@20350	
coriolanus@20351	VOLUMNIA	One on 's father's moods.

coriolanus@20559	VIRGILIA	No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

coriolanus@20669	VIRGILIA	Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
coriolanus@20726		threshold till my lord return from the wars.
coriolanus@20772	
coriolanus@20773	VALERIA	Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
coriolanus@20832		you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
coriolanus@20879	
coriolanus@20880	VIRGILIA	I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
coriolanus@20941		my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
coriolanus@20979	
coriolanus@20980	VOLUMNIA	Why, I pray you?
coriolanus@21006	
coriolanus@21007	VIRGILIA	'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
coriolanus@21063	
coriolanus@21064	VALERIA	You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
coriolanus@21122		the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
coriolanus@21174		Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
coriolanus@21224		were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
coriolanus@21276		pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
coriolanus@21327	
coriolanus@21328	VIRGILIA	No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
coriolanus@21390	
coriolanus@21391	VALERIA	In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
coriolanus@21443		excellent news of your husband.

coriolanus@21586		him last night.
coriolanus@21603	
coriolanus@21604	VIRGILIA	Indeed, madam?
coriolanus@21628	
coriolanus@21629	VALERIA	In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
coriolanus@21688		Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
coriolanus@21741		whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
coriolanus@21794		our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
coriolanus@21848		down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
coriolanus@21900		prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
coriolanus@21953		on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
coriolanus@21998	
coriolanus@21999	VIRGILIA	Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
coriolanus@22061		thing hereafter.
coriolanus@22079	
coriolanus@22080	VOLUMNIA	Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
coriolanus@22138		disease our better mirth.
coriolanus@22165	
coriolanus@22166	VALERIA	In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
coriolanus@22224		Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
coriolanus@22276		solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
coriolanus@22322	
coriolanus@22323	VIRGILIA	No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
coriolanus@22381		you much mirth.

coriolanus@22596	
coriolanus@22597	MARCIUS	Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
coriolanus@22647	
coriolanus@22648	LARTIUS	My horse to yours, no.
coriolanus@22679	
coriolanus@22680	MARCIUS	'Tis done.
coriolanus@22699	
coriolanus@22700	LARTIUS	Agreed.
coriolanus@22716	
coriolanus@22717	MARCIUS	Say, has our general met the enemy?
coriolanus@22761	
coriolanus@22762	Messenger	They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
coriolanus@22817	
coriolanus@22818	LARTIUS	So, the good horse is mine.
coriolanus@22854	
coriolanus@22855	MARCIUS	I'll buy him of you.
coriolanus@22884	
coriolanus@22885	LARTIUS	No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
coriolanus@22945		For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
coriolanus@22989	
coriolanus@22990	MARCIUS	How far off lie these armies?
coriolanus@23028	
coriolanus@23029	Messenger	Within this mile and half.
coriolanus@23066	
coriolanus@23067	MARCIUS	Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
coriolanus@23123		Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
coriolanus@23169		That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
coriolanus@23220		To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
coriolanus@23272

coriolanus@23327		on the walls]
coriolanus@23342	
coriolanus@23343		Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
coriolanus@23385	
coriolanus@23386	First Senator	No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
coriolanus@23443		That's lesser than a little.
coriolanus@23473	
coriolanus@23474		[Drums afar off]
coriolanus@23492	
coriolanus@23493			       Hark! our drums
coriolanus@23518		Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
coriolanus@23572		Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
coriolanus@23620		Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
coriolanus@23675		They'll open of themselves.
coriolanus@23704

coriolanus@23725			      Hark you. far off!
coriolanus@23752		There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
coriolanus@23797		Amongst your cloven army.
coriolanus@23824	
coriolanus@23825	MARCIUS	O, they are at it!
coriolanus@23852	
coriolanus@23853	LARTIUS	Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
coriolanus@23906	
coriolanus@23907		[Enter the army of the Volsces]
coriolanus@23940	
coriolanus@23941	MARCIUS	They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
coriolanus@23995		Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
coriolanus@24047		With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
coriolanus@24094		brave Titus:
coriolanus@24108		They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
coriolanus@24154		Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
coriolanus@24209		He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
coriolanus@24254		And he shall feel mine edge.
coriolanus@24284	
coriolanus@24285		[Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their
coriolanus@24329		trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing]
coriolanus@24366	
coriolanus@24367	MARCIUS	All the contagion of the south light on you,
coriolanus@24420		You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
coriolanus@24472		Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
coriolanus@24516		Further than seen and one infect another
coriolanus@24558		Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
coriolanus@24604		That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
coriolanus@24651		From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
coriolanus@24702		All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
coriolanus@24746		With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
coriolanus@24797		Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
coriolanus@24845		And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
coriolanus@24891		If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
coriolanus@24946		As they us to our trenches followed.
coriolanus@24984	
coriolanus@24985		[Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS
coriolanus@25032		follows them to the gates]
coriolanus@25060	
coriolanus@25061		So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
coriolanus@25113		'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
coriolanus@25158		Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

coriolanus@25469	
coriolanus@25470	All	Slain, sir, doubtless.
coriolanus@25497	
coriolanus@25498	First Soldier	Following the fliers at the very heels,
coriolanus@25552		With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
coriolanus@25596		Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
coriolanus@25642		To answer all the city.
coriolanus@25667	
coriolanus@25668	LARTIUS	O noble fellow!
coriolanus@25692		Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
coriolanus@25736		And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
coriolanus@25791		A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
coriolanus@25832		Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
coriolanus@25879		Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
coriolanus@25925		Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
coriolanus@25972		The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
coriolanus@26016		Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
coriolanus@26065		Were feverous and did tremble.

coriolanus@26689		Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
coriolanus@26735		Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
coriolanus@26787		Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
coriolanus@26840		And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
coriolanus@26889		There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
coriolanus@26936		Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
coriolanus@26984		Convenient numbers to make good the city;
coriolanus@27027		Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
coriolanus@27082		To help Cominius.
coriolanus@27101	
coriolanus@27102	LARTIUS	                  Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
coriolanus@27155		Thy exercise hath been too violent for
coriolanus@27195		A second course of fight.
coriolanus@27222	
coriolanus@27223	MARCIUS	Sir, praise me not;
coriolanus@27251		My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
coriolanus@27299		The blood I drop is rather physical
coriolanus@27336		Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
coriolanus@27376		I will appear, and fight.
coriolanus@27403	
coriolanus@27404	LARTIUS	Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
coriolanus@27443		Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms

coriolanus@28886		Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel

coriolanus@29706		Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
coriolanus@29752		Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
coriolanus@29803		Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
coriolanus@29841		Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
coriolanus@29886		To let him slip at will.
coriolanus@29912	
coriolanus@29913	COMINIUS	Where is that slave
coriolanus@29942		Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
coriolanus@29993		Where is he? call him hither.
coriolanus@30024	
coriolanus@30025	MARCIUS	Let him alone;

coriolanus@30404

coriolanus@30423		We have at disadvantage fought and did
coriolanus@30463		Retire to win our purpose.
coriolanus@30491	
coriolanus@30492	MARCIUS	How lies their battle? know you on which side
coriolanus@30546		They have placed their men of trust?
coriolanus@30584	
coriolanus@30585	COMINIUS	As I guess, Marcius,
coriolanus@30615		Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
coriolanus@30660		Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
coriolanus@30702		Their very heart of hope.
coriolanus@30729	
coriolanus@30730	MARCIUS	I do beseech you,
coriolanus@30756		By all the battles wherein we have fought,
coriolanus@30800		By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
coriolanus@30849		We have made to endure friends, that you directly
coriolanus@30900		Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
coriolanus@30943		And that you not delay the present, but,
coriolanus@30985		Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
coriolanus@31034		We prove this very hour.
coriolanus@31060	
coriolanus@31061	COMINIUS	Though I could wish
coriolanus@31090		You were conducted to a gentle bath
coriolanus@31127		And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
coriolanus@31172		Deny your asking: take your choice of those
coriolanus@31217		That best can aid your action.
coriolanus@31249	
coriolanus@31250	MARCIUS	Those are they
coriolanus@31273		That most are willing. If any such be here--
coriolanus@31319		As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
coriolanus@31369		Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
coriolanus@31410		Lesser his person than an ill report;
coriolanus@31449		If any think brave death outweighs bad life
coriolanus@31494		And that his country's dearer than himself;
coriolanus@31539		Let him alone, or so many so minded,
coriolanus@31577		Wave thus, to express his disposition,
coriolanus@31617		And follow Marcius.

coriolanus@31770		If these shows be not outward, which of you
coriolanus@31815		But is four Volsces? none of you but is
coriolanus@31856		Able to bear against the great Aufidius
coriolanus@31897		A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
coriolanus@31941		Though thanks to all, must I select
coriolanus@31978		from all: the rest
coriolanus@31998		Shall bear the business in some other fight,

coriolanus@32981		MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS]
coriolanus@33004	
coriolanus@33005	MARCIUS	I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
coriolanus@33063		Worse than a promise-breaker.
coriolanus@33094	
coriolanus@33095	AUFIDIUS	We hate alike:
coriolanus@33119		Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
coriolanus@33153		More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
coriolanus@33197	
coriolanus@33198	MARCIUS	Let the first budger die the other's slave,
coriolanus@33250		And the gods doom him after!
coriolanus@33280	
coriolanus@33281	AUFIDIUS	If I fly, Marcius,
coriolanus@33309		Holloa me like a hare.
coriolanus@33333	
coriolanus@33334	MARCIUS	Within these three hours, Tullus,
coriolanus@33376		Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
coriolanus@33415		And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
coriolanus@33464		Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
coriolanus@33511		Wrench up thy power to the highest.
coriolanus@33548	
coriolanus@33549	AUFIDIUS	Wert thou the Hector
coriolanus@33579		That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
coriolanus@33623		Thou shouldst not scape me here.
coriolanus@33657	
coriolanus@33658		[They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of

coriolanus@33967		Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from
coriolanus@34021		the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf]

coriolanus@34073	COMINIUS	If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
coriolanus@34130		Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it

coriolanus@34637		from the pursuit]
coriolanus@34656	
coriolanus@34657	LARTIUS	O general,
coriolanus@34676		Here is the steed, we the caparison:
coriolanus@34714		Hadst thou beheld--
coriolanus@34735	
coriolanus@34736	MARCIUS	Pray now, no more: my mother,
coriolanus@34774		Who has a charter to extol her blood,
coriolanus@34813		When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
coriolanus@34862		As you have done; that's what I can; induced
coriolanus@34908		As you have been; that's for my country:
coriolanus@34950		He that has but effected his good will
coriolanus@34990		Hath overta'en mine act.
coriolanus@35016	
coriolanus@35017	COMINIUS	You shall not be
coriolanus@35043		The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
coriolanus@35088		The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
coriolanus@35132		Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
coriolanus@35181		To hide your doings; and to silence that,
coriolanus@35224		Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
coriolanus@35273		Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
coriolanus@35322		In sign of what you are, not to reward
coriolanus@35362		What you have done--before our army hear me.
coriolanus@35408	
coriolanus@35409	MARCIUS	I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
coriolanus@35460		To hear themselves remember'd.
coriolanus@35492	
coriolanus@35493	COMINIUS	Should they not,
coriolanus@35519		Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
coriolanus@35564		And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
coriolanus@35616		Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
coriolanus@35667		The treasure in this field achieved and city,
coriolanus@35714		We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
coriolanus@35759		Before the common distribution, at
coriolanus@35795		Your only choice.
coriolanus@35814	
coriolanus@35815	MARCIUS	                  I thank you, general;

coriolanus@35905		A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;

coriolanus@36299		Made all of false-faced soothing!

coriolanus@36520		Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
coriolanus@36572		You shout me forth
coriolanus@36592		In acclamations hyperbolical;

coriolanus@36696	COMINIUS	Too modest are you;

coriolanus@36817		If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
coriolanus@36870		Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,

coriolanus@37023		Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
coriolanus@37073		My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
coriolanus@37121		With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
coriolanus@37171		For what he did before Corioli, call him,
coriolanus@37214		With all the applause and clamour of the host,

coriolanus@37465		Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
coriolanus@37511		I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
coriolanus@37558		To undercrest your good addition
coriolanus@37592		To the fairness of my power.
coriolanus@37622	
coriolanus@37623	COMINIUS	So, to our tent;
coriolanus@37649		Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
coriolanus@37692		To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
coriolanus@37737		Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
coriolanus@37776		The best, with whom we may articulate,
coriolanus@37816		For their own good and ours.
coriolanus@37846	
coriolanus@37847	LARTIUS	I shall, my lord.
coriolanus@37873

coriolanus@37970		Of my lord general.
coriolanus@37991	
coriolanus@37992	COMINIUS	Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
coriolanus@38032	
coriolanus@38033	CORIOLANUS	I sometime lay here in Corioli
coriolanus@38075		At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
coriolanus@38118		He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
coriolanus@38155		But then Aufidius was within my view,
coriolanus@38194		And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
coriolanus@38240		To give my poor host freedom.
coriolanus@38271	
coriolanus@38272	COMINIUS	O, well begg'd!
coriolanus@38297		Were he the butcher of my son, he should
coriolanus@38339		Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
coriolanus@38384	
coriolanus@38385	LARTIUS	Marcius, his name?

coriolanus@38413	CORIOLANUS	                  By Jupiter! forgot.
coriolanus@38462		I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
coriolanus@38500		Have we no wine here?
coriolanus@38523	
coriolanus@38524	COMINIUS	Go we to our tent:
coriolanus@38552		The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time

coriolanus@39206		If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,

coriolanus@40526	BRUTUS	Good or bad?

coriolanus@40825	
coriolanus@40826	BRUTUS	He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

coriolanus@41181	BRUTUS	And topping all others in boasting.
coriolanus@41224

coriolanus@41455	Both	Well, well, sir, well.
coriolanus@41483	
coriolanus@41484	MENENIUS	Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
coriolanus@41547		occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
coriolanus@41599		give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
coriolanus@41650		your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
coriolanus@41700		pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
coriolanus@41752		being proud?
coriolanus@41766	
coriolanus@41767	BRUTUS	We do it not alone, sir.
coriolanus@41799	
coriolanus@41800	MENENIUS	I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
coriolanus@41861		are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
coriolanus@41913		single: your abilities are too infant-like for
coriolanus@41961		doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
coriolanus@42010		could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
coriolanus@42064		and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
coriolanus@42118		O that you could!

coriolanus@42138	BRUTUS	What then, sir?

coriolanus@42224		proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
coriolanus@42276		any in Rome.
coriolanus@42290	
coriolanus@42291	SICINIUS	Menenius, you are known well enough too.
coriolanus@42341	
coriolanus@42342	MENENIUS	I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
coriolanus@42403		loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
coriolanus@42456		Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
coriolanus@42503		favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
coriolanus@42557		upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
coriolanus@42607		with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
coriolanus@42661		of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
coriolanus@42713		malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
coriolanus@42764		you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
coriolanus@42817		you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
coriolanus@42866		crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
coriolanus@42918		delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
coriolanus@42969		compound with the major part of your syllables: and
coriolanus@43022		though I must be content to bear with those that say
coriolanus@43076		you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
coriolanus@43130		tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
coriolanus@43180		the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
coriolanus@43233		well enough too? what barm can your bisson
coriolanus@43277		conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
coriolanus@43330		known well enough too?
coriolanus@43354	
coriolanus@43355	BRUTUS	Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
coriolanus@43404	
coriolanus@43405	MENENIUS	You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
coriolanus@43465		are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
coriolanus@43516		wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
coriolanus@43565		cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
coriolanus@43616		and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
coriolanus@43670		second day of audience. When you are hearing a
coriolanus@43718		matter between party and party, if you chance to be
coriolanus@43771		pinched with the colic, you make faces like
coriolanus@43816		mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
coriolanus@43861		patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
coriolanus@43907		dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
coriolanus@43960		by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
coriolanus@44010		cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
coriolanus@44062		a pair of strange ones.
coriolanus@44087	
coriolanus@44088	BRUTUS	Come, come, you are well understood to be a
coriolanus@44139		perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
coriolanus@44187		bencher in the Capitol.
coriolanus@44212	
coriolanus@44213	MENENIUS	Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
coriolanus@44274		encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
coriolanus@44327		you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
coriolanus@44381		wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
coriolanus@44434		so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
coriolanus@44481		cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
coriolanus@44527		saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
coriolanus@44578		who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
coriolanus@44628		since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
coriolanus@44678		best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
coriolanus@44727		your worships: more of your conversation would
coriolanus@44775		infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
coriolanus@44827		plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.

coriolanus@44913		[Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA]
coriolanus@44954	
coriolanus@44955		How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
coriolanus@45008		were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
coriolanus@45061		your eyes so fast?
coriolanus@45081	
coriolanus@45082	VOLUMNIA	Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
coriolanus@45143		the love of Juno, let's go.
coriolanus@45172	
coriolanus@45173	MENENIUS	Ha! Marcius coming home!
coriolanus@45207	
coriolanus@45208	VOLUMNIA	Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
coriolanus@45263		approbation.
coriolanus@45277	
coriolanus@45278	MENENIUS	Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
coriolanus@45332		Marcius coming home!
coriolanus@45354	
coriolanus@45355	
coriolanus@45356	VOLUMNIA	|
coriolanus@45367		|  Nay,'tis true.
coriolanus@45386	VIRGILIA	|
coriolanus@45397	
coriolanus@45398	
coriolanus@45399	VOLUMNIA	Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
coriolanus@45455		another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
coriolanus@45509		at home for you.
coriolanus@45527	
coriolanus@45528	MENENIUS	I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
coriolanus@45590		me!
coriolanus@45595	
coriolanus@45596	VIRGILIA	Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
coriolanus@45654	
coriolanus@45655	MENENIUS	A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
coriolanus@45712		years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
coriolanus@45763		the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
coriolanus@45814		Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
coriolanus@45868		of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
coriolanus@45916		not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
coriolanus@45964	
coriolanus@45965	VIRGILIA	O, no, no, no.
coriolanus@45989	
coriolanus@45990	VOLUMNIA	O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
coriolanus@46041	
coriolanus@46042	MENENIUS	So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
coriolanus@46097		victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
coriolanus@46144	
coriolanus@46145	VOLUMNIA	On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
coriolanus@46205		with the oaken garland.
coriolanus@46230	
coriolanus@46231	MENENIUS	Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
coriolanus@46277	
coriolanus@46278	VOLUMNIA	Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
coriolanus@46335		Aufidius got off.
coriolanus@46354	
coriolanus@46355	MENENIUS	And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
coriolanus@46415		an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
coriolanus@46466		fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
coriolanus@46520		that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
coriolanus@46570	
coriolanus@46571	VOLUMNIA	Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
coriolanus@46629		has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
coriolanus@46680		son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
coriolanus@46728		action outdone his former deeds doubly
coriolanus@46768	
coriolanus@46769	VALERIA	In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
coriolanus@46825	
coriolanus@46826	MENENIUS	Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
coriolanus@46884		true purchasing.
coriolanus@46902	
coriolanus@46903	VIRGILIA	The gods grant them true!
coriolanus@46938	
coriolanus@46939	VOLUMNIA	True! pow, wow.
coriolanus@46964	
coriolanus@46965	MENENIUS	True! I'll be sworn they are true.
coriolanus@47009		Where is he wounded?
coriolanus@47031	
coriolanus@47032		[To the Tribunes]
coriolanus@47051	
coriolanus@47052		God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
coriolanus@47100		home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
coriolanus@47159	
coriolanus@47160	VOLUMNIA	I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
coriolanus@47219		large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
coriolanus@47271		stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
coriolanus@47323		Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
coriolanus@47357	
coriolanus@47358	MENENIUS	One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
coriolanus@47415		nine that I know.
coriolanus@47434	
coriolanus@47435	VOLUMNIA	He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
coriolanus@47493		wounds upon him.
coriolanus@47511	
coriolanus@47512	MENENIUS	Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
coriolanus@47577	
coriolanus@47578		[A shout and flourish]
coriolanus@47602	
coriolanus@47603		Hark! the trumpets.
coriolanus@47624	
coriolanus@47625	VOLUMNIA	These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
coriolanus@47681		carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
coriolanus@47729		Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
coriolanus@47781		Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
coriolanus@47833	
coriolanus@47834		[A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
coriolanus@47881		general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS,
coriolanus@47936		crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and
coriolanus@47986		Soldiers, and a Herald]
coriolanus@48011	
coriolanus@48012	Herald	Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
coriolanus@48064		Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
coriolanus@48106		With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
coriolanus@48149		In honour follows Coriolanus.
coriolanus@48180		Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

coriolanus@48349	
coriolanus@48350	COMINIUS	                  Look, sir, your mother!
coriolanus@48401	
coriolanus@48402	CORIOLANUS	O,
coriolanus@48416		You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
coriolanus@48459		For my prosperity!
coriolanus@48479	
coriolanus@48480		[Kneels]
coriolanus@48490	
coriolanus@48491	VOLUMNIA	                  Nay, my good soldier, up;
coriolanus@48544		My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
coriolanus@48582		By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
coriolanus@48623		What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
coriolanus@48668		But O, thy wife!
coriolanus@48686	
coriolanus@48687	CORIOLANUS	                  My gracious silence, hail!
coriolanus@48743		Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
coriolanus@48796		That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
coriolanus@48842		Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
coriolanus@48881		And mothers that lack sons.
coriolanus@48910	
coriolanus@48911	MENENIUS	Now, the gods crown thee!
coriolanus@48946	
coriolanus@48947	CORIOLANUS	And live you yet?
coriolanus@48976	
coriolanus@48977		[To VALERIA]
coriolanus@48991		O my sweet lady, pardon.
coriolanus@49017	
coriolanus@49018	VOLUMNIA	I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
coriolanus@49070		And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
coriolanus@49116	
coriolanus@49117	MENENIUS	A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
coriolanus@49168		And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
coriolanus@49219		A curse begin at very root on's heart,
coriolanus@49259		That is not glad to see thee! You are three
coriolanus@49304		That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
coriolanus@49357		We have some old crab-trees here
coriolanus@49391		at home that will not
coriolanus@49414		Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
coriolanus@49465		We call a nettle but a nettle and
coriolanus@49500		The faults of fools but folly.
coriolanus@49532	
coriolanus@49533	COMINIUS	Ever right.

coriolanus@49684		Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
coriolanus@49726		The good patricians must be visited;
coriolanus@49764		From whom I have received not only greetings,
coriolanus@49811		But with them change of honours.
coriolanus@49845	
coriolanus@49846	VOLUMNIA	I have lived
coriolanus@49868		To see inherited my very wishes
coriolanus@49901		And the buildings of my fancy: only
coriolanus@49938		There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
coriolanus@49988		Our Rome will cast upon thee.
coriolanus@50019	
coriolanus@50020	CORIOLANUS	Know, good mother,
coriolanus@50050		I had rather be their servant in my way,
coriolanus@50092		Than sway with them in theirs.
coriolanus@50124	
coriolanus@50125	COMINIUS	On, to the Capitol!
coriolanus@50154	
coriolanus@50155		[Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before.
coriolanus@50204		BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward]
coriolanus@50239	
coriolanus@50240	BRUTUS	All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
coriolanus@50296		Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
coriolanus@50345		Into a rapture lets her baby cry
coriolanus@50379		While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
coriolanus@50425		Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
coriolanus@50469		Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
coriolanus@50527		Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
coriolanus@50578		With variable complexions, all agreeing
coriolanus@50619		In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
coriolanus@50666		Do press among the popular throngs and puff
coriolanus@50711		To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
coriolanus@50753		Commit the war of white and damask in
coriolanus@50792		Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
coriolanus@50840		Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
coriolanus@50883		As if that whatsoever god who leads him
coriolanus@50924		Were slily crept into his human powers
coriolanus@50964		And gave him graceful posture.
coriolanus@50996	
coriolanus@50997	SICINIUS	On the sudden,
coriolanus@51021		I warrant him consul.
coriolanus@51044	
coriolanus@51045	BRUTUS	Then our office may,
coriolanus@51073		During his power, go sleep.
coriolanus@51102	
coriolanus@51103	SICINIUS	He cannot temperately transport his honours
coriolanus@51156		From where he should begin and end, but will
coriolanus@51202		Lose those he hath won.
coriolanus@51227	
coriolanus@51228	BRUTUS	In that there's comfort.
coriolanus@51260	
coriolanus@51261	SICINIUS	Doubt not
coriolanus@51280		The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
coriolanus@51324		Upon their ancient malice will forget
coriolanus@51363		With the least cause these his new honours, which
coriolanus@51414		That he will give them make I as little question
coriolanus@51464		As he is proud to do't.
coriolanus@51489	
coriolanus@51490	BRUTUS	I heard him swear,
coriolanus@51516		Were he to stand for consul, never would he
coriolanus@51561		Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
coriolanus@51604		The napless vesture of humility;
coriolanus@51638		Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
coriolanus@51681		To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
coriolanus@51725	
coriolanus@51726	SICINIUS	'Tis right.
coriolanus@51747	
coriolanus@51748	BRUTUS	It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
coriolanus@51799		Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
coriolanus@51852		And the desire of the nobles.
coriolanus@51883	
coriolanus@51884	SICINIUS	I wish no better
coriolanus@51910		Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
coriolanus@51957		In execution.
coriolanus@51972	
coriolanus@51973	BRUTUS	'Tis most like he will.
coriolanus@52004	
coriolanus@52005	SICINIUS	It shall be to him then as our good wills,
coriolanus@52057		A sure destruction.
coriolanus@52078	
coriolanus@52079	BRUTUS	So it must fall out
coriolanus@52106		To him or our authorities. For an end,
coriolanus@52146		We must suggest the people in what hatred
coriolanus@52189		He still hath held them; that to's power he would
coriolanus@52240		Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
coriolanus@52291		Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
coriolanus@52336		In human action and capacity,
coriolanus@52367		Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
coriolanus@52410		Than camels in the war, who have their provand
coriolanus@52458		Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
coriolanus@52500		For sinking under them.
coriolanus@52525	
coriolanus@52526	SICINIUS	This, as you say, suggested
coriolanus@52563		At some time when his soaring insolence
coriolanus@52604		Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
coriolanus@52656		If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
coriolanus@52698		As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
coriolanus@52741		To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
coriolanus@52787		Shall darken him for ever.
coriolanus@52815	
coriolanus@52816		[Enter a Messenger]
coriolanus@52837	
coriolanus@52838	BRUTUS	What's the matter?
coriolanus@52864	
coriolanus@52865	Messenger	You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
coriolanus@52921		That Marcius shall be consul:
coriolanus@52952		I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
coriolanus@53000		The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
coriolanus@53052		Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
coriolanus@53101		Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
coriolanus@53144		As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
coriolanus@53187		A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
coriolanus@53237		I never saw the like.
coriolanus@53260	
coriolanus@53261	BRUTUS	Let's to the Capitol;
coriolanus@53290		And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
coriolanus@53337		But hearts for the event.
coriolanus@53364

coriolanus@53461	
coriolanus@53462	
coriolanus@53463		[Enter two Officers, to lay cushions]
coriolanus@53502	
coriolanus@53503	First Officer	Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
coriolanus@53566		for consulships?
coriolanus@53584	
coriolanus@53585	Second Officer	Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
coriolanus@53647		Coriolanus will carry it.
coriolanus@53674	
coriolanus@53675	First Officer	That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
coriolanus@53742		loves not the common people.
coriolanus@53772	
coriolanus@53773	Second Officer	Faith, there had been many great men that have
coriolanus@53835		flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
coriolanus@53890		be many that they have loved, they know not
coriolanus@53935		wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
coriolanus@53988		they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
coriolanus@54039		Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
coriolanus@54093		him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
coriolanus@54143		disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
coriolanus@54196		them plainly see't.
coriolanus@54217	
coriolanus@54218	First Officer	If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
coriolanus@54284		he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
coriolanus@54334		good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
coriolanus@54387		devotion than can render it him; and leaves
coriolanus@54432		nothing undone that may fully discover him their
coriolanus@54482		opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
coriolanus@54531		displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
coriolanus@54585		dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
coriolanus@54628	
coriolanus@54629	Second Officer	He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
coriolanus@54694		ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
coriolanus@54744		having been supple and courteous to the people,
coriolanus@54793		bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
coriolanus@54845		an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
coriolanus@54898		planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
coriolanus@54950		in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
coriolanus@54997		silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
coriolanus@55046		ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
coriolanus@55094		malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
coriolanus@55144		reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
coriolanus@55194	
coriolanus@55195	First Officer	No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
coriolanus@55260		are coming.

coriolanus@56705		But yet my caution was more pertinent
coriolanus@56744		Than the rebuke you give it.
coriolanus@56774	
coriolanus@56775	MENENIUS	He loves your people
coriolanus@56805		But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
coriolanus@56845		Worthy Cominius, speak.
coriolanus@56870	
coriolanus@56871		[CORIOLANUS offers to go away]
coriolanus@56903	
coriolanus@56904			  Nay, keep your place.
coriolanus@56930	
coriolanus@56931	First Senator	Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
coriolanus@56982		What you have nobly done.
coriolanus@57009	
coriolanus@57010	CORIOLANUS	Your horror's pardon:
coriolanus@57043		I had rather have my wounds to heal again
coriolanus@57086		Than hear say how I got them.
coriolanus@57117	
coriolanus@57118	BRUTUS	Sir, I hope
coriolanus@57137		My words disbench'd you not.
coriolanus@57167	
coriolanus@57168	CORIOLANUS	No, sir: yet oft,
coriolanus@57197		When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
coriolanus@57247		You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
coriolanus@57289		your people,
coriolanus@57303		I love them as they weigh.
coriolanus@57331	
coriolanus@57332	MENENIUS	Pray now, sit down.
coriolanus@57361	
coriolanus@57362	CORIOLANUS	I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
coriolanus@57422		When the alarum were struck than idly sit
coriolanus@57465		To hear my nothings monster'd.
coriolanus@57497	
coriolanus@57498		[Exit]
coriolanus@57506	
coriolanus@57507	MENENIUS	Masters of the people,
coriolanus@57539		Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
coriolanus@57584		That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
coriolanus@57635		He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
coriolanus@57683		Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
coriolanus@57734	
coriolanus@57735	COMINIUS	I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
coriolanus@57788		Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
coriolanus@57830		That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
coriolanus@57871		Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
coriolanus@57908		The man I speak of cannot in the world
coriolanus@57948		Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
coriolanus@57992		When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
coriolanus@58038		Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
coriolanus@58085		Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
coriolanus@58134		When with his Amazonian chin he drove
coriolanus@58173		The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
coriolanus@58215		An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
coriolanus@58263		Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
coriolanus@58308		And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
coriolanus@58358		When he might act the woman in the scene,
coriolanus@58401		He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
coriolanus@58452		Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
coriolanus@58496		Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
coriolanus@58536		And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
coriolanus@58581		He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
coriolanus@58635		Before and in Corioli, let me say,
coriolanus@58671		I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
coriolanus@58720		And by his rare example made the coward
coriolanus@58761		Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
coriolanus@58802		A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
coriolanus@58838		And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
coriolanus@58890		Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
coriolanus@58937		He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
coriolanus@58982		Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
coriolanus@59028		The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
coriolanus@59075		With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
coriolanus@59117		And with a sudden reinforcement struck
coriolanus@59157		Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
coriolanus@59196		When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
coriolanus@59240		His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
coriolanus@59291		Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
coriolanus@59333		And to the battle came he; where he did
coriolanus@59374		Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
coriolanus@59416		'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
coriolanus@59462		Both field and city ours, he never stood
coriolanus@59504		To ease his breast with panting.
coriolanus@59538	
coriolanus@59539	MENENIUS	Worthy man!
coriolanus@59560	
coriolanus@59561	First Senator	He cannot but with measure fit the honours
coriolanus@59618		Which we devise him.
coriolanus@59640	
coriolanus@59641	COMINIUS	Our spoils he kick'd at,
coriolanus@59675		And look'd upon things precious as they were
coriolanus@59721		The common muck of the world: he covets less
coriolanus@59767		Than misery itself would give; rewards
coriolanus@59807		His deeds with doing them, and is content
coriolanus@59850		To spend the time to end it.
coriolanus@59880	
coriolanus@59881	MENENIUS	He's right noble:
coriolanus@59908		Let him be call'd for.
coriolanus@59932	
coriolanus@59933	First Senator	Call Coriolanus.
coriolanus@59964	
coriolanus@59965	Officer	He doth appear.
coriolanus@59989	
coriolanus@59990		[Re-enter CORIOLANUS]
coriolanus@60013	
coriolanus@60014	MENENIUS	The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
coriolanus@60064		To make thee consul.
coriolanus@60086	
coriolanus@60087	CORIOLANUS	I do owe them still
coriolanus@60118		My life and services.
coriolanus@60141	
coriolanus@60142	MENENIUS	It then remains
coriolanus@60167		That you do speak to the people.
coriolanus@60201	
coriolanus@60202	CORIOLANUS	I do beseech you,
coriolanus@60231		Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
coriolanus@60274		Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
coriolanus@60322		For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
coriolanus@60379		That I may pass this doing.
coriolanus@60408	
coriolanus@60409	SICINIUS	Sir, the people
coriolanus@60434		Must have their voices; neither will they bate
coriolanus@60482		One jot of ceremony.
coriolanus@60504	
coriolanus@60505	MENENIUS	Put them not to't:
coriolanus@60533		Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
coriolanus@60573		Take to you, as your predecessors have,
coriolanus@60614		Your honour with your form.
coriolanus@60643	
coriolanus@60644	CORIOLANUS	It is apart
coriolanus@60667		That I shall blush in acting, and might well
coriolanus@60713		Be taken from the people.
coriolanus@60740	
coriolanus@60741	BRUTUS	Mark you that?
coriolanus@60763	
coriolanus@60764	CORIOLANUS	To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
coriolanus@60816		Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
coriolanus@60867		As if I had received them for the hire
coriolanus@60907		Of their breath only!
coriolanus@60930	
coriolanus@60931	MENENIUS	Do not stand upon't.
coriolanus@60961		We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
coriolanus@61007		Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
coriolanus@61053		Wish we all joy and honour.
coriolanus@61082	
coriolanus@61083	Senators	To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
coriolanus@61131	
coriolanus@61132		[Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS
coriolanus@61179		and BRUTUS]
coriolanus@61192	
coriolanus@61193	BRUTUS	You see how he intends to use the people.
coriolanus@61242	
coriolanus@61243	SICINIUS	May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
coriolanus@61302		As if he did contemn what he requested
coriolanus@61342		Should be in them to give.
coriolanus@61370	
coriolanus@61371	BRUTUS	Come, we'll inform them
coriolanus@61402		Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
coriolanus@61448		I know, they do attend us.
coriolanus@61476

coriolanus@61505	ACT II
coriolanus@61512	
coriolanus@61513	
coriolanus@61514	
coriolanus@61515	SCENE III	The same. The Forum.
coriolanus@61546	
coriolanus@61547	
coriolanus@61548		[Enter seven or eight Citizens]
coriolanus@61581	
coriolanus@61582	First Citizen	Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
coriolanus@61657	
coriolanus@61658	Second Citizen	We may, sir, if we will.
coriolanus@61698	
coriolanus@61699	Third Citizen	We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
coriolanus@61762		power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
coriolanus@61816		his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
coriolanus@61869		tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
coriolanus@61923		he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
coriolanus@61974		our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
coriolanus@62020		monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
coriolanus@62072		were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
coriolanus@62121		which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
coriolanus@62175		monstrous members.
coriolanus@62195	
coriolanus@62196	First Citizen	And to make us no better thought of, a little help
coriolanus@62261		will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
coriolanus@62314		himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
coriolanus@62371	
coriolanus@62372	Third Citizen	We have been called so of many; not that our heads
coriolanus@62437		are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
coriolanus@62490		but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
coriolanus@62540		truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
coriolanus@62592		one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
coriolanus@62645		and their consent of one direct way should be at
coriolanus@62695		once to all the points o' the compass.
coriolanus@62735	
coriolanus@62736	Second Citizen	Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
coriolanus@62801		fly?
coriolanus@62807	
coriolanus@62808	Third Citizen	Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
coriolanus@62874		will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
coriolanus@62925		if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.
coriolanus@62975	
coriolanus@62976	Second Citizen	Why that way?
coriolanus@63005	
coriolanus@63006	Third Citizen	To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
coriolanus@63069		melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
coriolanus@63124		for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
coriolanus@63174	
coriolanus@63175	Second Citizen	You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
coriolanus@63243	
coriolanus@63244	Third Citizen	Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
coriolanus@63304		that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
coriolanus@63354		say, if he would incline to the people, there was
coriolanus@63405		never a worthier man.
coriolanus@63428	
coriolanus@63429		[Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility,
coriolanus@63471		with MENENIUS]
coriolanus@63487	
coriolanus@63488		Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
coriolanus@63542		behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
coriolanus@63593		come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
coriolanus@63645		by threes. He's to make his requests by
coriolanus@63686		particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
coriolanus@63737		honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
coriolanus@63788		tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
coriolanus@63840		you shall go by him.
coriolanus@63862	
coriolanus@63863	All	Content, content.
coriolanus@63885	
coriolanus@63886		[Exeunt Citizens]
coriolanus@63905	
coriolanus@63906	MENENIUS	O sir, you are not right: have you not known
coriolanus@63960		The worthiest men have done't?
coriolanus@63992	
coriolanus@63993	CORIOLANUS	What must I say?
coriolanus@64021		'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
coriolanus@64067		My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
coriolanus@64118		I got them in my country's service, when
coriolanus@64160		Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
coriolanus@64206		From the noise of our own drums.'
coriolanus@64241	
coriolanus@64242	MENENIUS	O me, the gods!
coriolanus@64267		You must not speak of that: you must desire them
coriolanus@64317		To think upon you.
coriolanus@64337	
coriolanus@64338	CORIOLANUS	                  Think upon me! hang 'em!
coriolanus@64392		I would they would forget me, like the virtues
coriolanus@64440		Which our divines lose by 'em.
coriolanus@64472	
coriolanus@64473	MENENIUS	You'll mar all:
coriolanus@64498		I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
coriolanus@64551		In wholesome manner.
coriolanus@64573	
coriolanus@64574		[Exit]
coriolanus@64582	
coriolanus@64583	CORIOLANUS	Bid them wash their faces
coriolanus@64620		And keep their teeth clean.
coriolanus@64649	
coriolanus@64650		[Re-enter two of the Citizens]
coriolanus@64682	
coriolanus@64683			      So, here comes a brace.
coriolanus@64715	
coriolanus@64716		[Re-enter a third Citizen]
coriolanus@64744	
coriolanus@64745		You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
coriolanus@64792	
coriolanus@64793	Third Citizen	We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
coriolanus@64855	
coriolanus@64856	CORIOLANUS	Mine own desert.
coriolanus@64884	
coriolanus@64885	Second Citizen	Your own desert!
coriolanus@64917	
coriolanus@64918	CORIOLANUS	Ay, but not mine own desire.
coriolanus@64958	
coriolanus@64959	Third Citizen	How not your own desire?
coriolanus@64998	
coriolanus@64999	CORIOLANUS	No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
coriolanus@65059		poor with begging.
coriolanus@65079	
coriolanus@65080	Third Citizen	You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
coriolanus@65147		gain by you.
coriolanus@65161	
coriolanus@65162	CORIOLANUS	Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
coriolanus@65222	
coriolanus@65223	First Citizen	The price is to ask it kindly.
coriolanus@65268	
coriolanus@65269	CORIOLANUS	Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
coriolanus@65331		show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
coriolanus@65380		good voice, sir; what say you?
coriolanus@65412	
coriolanus@65413	Second Citizen	You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
coriolanus@65458	
coriolanus@65459	CORIOLANUS	A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
coriolanus@65517		begged. I have your alms: adieu.
coriolanus@65551	
coriolanus@65552	Third Citizen	But this is something odd.
coriolanus@65593	
coriolanus@65594	Second Citizen	An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
coriolanus@65655	
coriolanus@65656		[Exeunt the three Citizens]
coriolanus@65685	
coriolanus@65686		[Re-enter two other Citizens]
coriolanus@65717	
coriolanus@65718	CORIOLANUS	Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
coriolanus@65781		voices that I may be consul, I have here the
coriolanus@65827		customary gown.
coriolanus@65844	
coriolanus@65845	Fourth Citizen	You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
coriolanus@65909		have not deserved nobly.
coriolanus@65935	
coriolanus@65936	CORIOLANUS	Your enigma?
coriolanus@65960	
coriolanus@65961	Fourth Citizen	You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
coriolanus@66025		been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
coriolanus@66079		the common people.
coriolanus@66099	
coriolanus@66100	CORIOLANUS	You should account me the more virtuous that I have
coriolanus@66163		not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
coriolanus@66216		sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
coriolanus@66261		estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
coriolanus@66312		gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
coriolanus@66361		rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
coriolanus@66415		the insinuating nod and be off to them most
coriolanus@66460		counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
coriolanus@66513		bewitchment of some popular man and give it
coriolanus@66558		bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
coriolanus@66610		I may be consul.
coriolanus@66628	
coriolanus@66629	Fifth Citizen	We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
coriolanus@66694		you our voices heartily.
coriolanus@66720	
coriolanus@66721	Fourth Citizen	You have received many wounds for your country.
coriolanus@66784	
coriolanus@66785	CORIOLANUS	I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
coriolanus@66848		will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
coriolanus@66911	
coriolanus@66912	Both Citizens	The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
coriolanus@66964	
coriolanus@66965		[Exeunt]
coriolanus@66975	
coriolanus@66976	CORIOLANUS	Most sweet voices!
coriolanus@67006		Better it is to die, better to starve,
coriolanus@67046		Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
coriolanus@67094		Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
coriolanus@67142		To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
coriolanus@67183		Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
coriolanus@67230		What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
coriolanus@67280		The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
coriolanus@67325		And mountainous error be too highly heapt
coriolanus@67368		For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
coriolanus@67417		Let the high office and the honour go
coriolanus@67456		To one that would do thus. I am half through;
coriolanus@67503		The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
coriolanus@67548	
coriolanus@67549		[Re-enter three Citizens more]
coriolanus@67581	
coriolanus@67582		Here come more voices.
coriolanus@67606		Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
coriolanus@67651		Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
coriolanus@67698		Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
coriolanus@67743		I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
coriolanus@67791		Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
coriolanus@67844		Indeed I would be consul.
coriolanus@67871	
coriolanus@67872	Sixth Citizen	He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
coriolanus@67938		man's voice.
coriolanus@67952	
coriolanus@67953	Seventh Citizen	Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
coriolanus@68021		and make him good friend to the people!
coriolanus@68062	
coriolanus@68063	All Citizens	Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
coriolanus@68117	
coriolanus@68118		[Exeunt]
coriolanus@68128	
coriolanus@68129	CORIOLANUS	Worthy voices!
coriolanus@68155	
coriolanus@68156		[Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS]
coriolanus@68203	
coriolanus@68204	MENENIUS	You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
coriolanus@68262		Endue you with the people's voice: remains
coriolanus@68306		That, in the official marks invested, you
coriolanus@68349		Anon do meet the senate.
coriolanus@68375	
coriolanus@68376	CORIOLANUS	Is this done?
coriolanus@68401	
coriolanus@68402	SICINIUS	The custom of request you have discharged:
coriolanus@68454		The people do admit you, and are summon'd
coriolanus@68497		To meet anon, upon your approbation.
coriolanus@68535	
coriolanus@68536	CORIOLANUS	Where? at the senate-house?
coriolanus@68575	
coriolanus@68576	SICINIUS	There, Coriolanus.
coriolanus@68604	
coriolanus@68605	CORIOLANUS	May I change these garments?
coriolanus@68645	
coriolanus@68646	SICINIUS	You may, sir.
coriolanus@68669	
coriolanus@68670	CORIOLANUS	That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
coriolanus@68731		Repair to the senate-house.
coriolanus@68760	
coriolanus@68761	MENENIUS	I'll keep you company. Will you along?
coriolanus@68809	
coriolanus@68810	BRUTUS	We stay here for the people.
coriolanus@68846	
coriolanus@68847	SICINIUS	Fare you well.
coriolanus@68871	
coriolanus@68872		[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS]
coriolanus@68906	
coriolanus@68907		He has it now, and by his looks methink
coriolanus@68948		'Tis warm at 's heart.
coriolanus@68972	
coriolanus@68973	BRUTUS	With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
coriolanus@69025		will you dismiss the people?
coriolanus@69055	
coriolanus@69056		[Re-enter Citizens]
coriolanus@69077	
coriolanus@69078	SICINIUS	How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
coriolanus@69133	
coriolanus@69134	First Citizen	He has our voices, sir.
coriolanus@69172	
coriolanus@69173	BRUTUS	We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
coriolanus@69224	
coriolanus@69225	Second Citizen	Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
coriolanus@69279		He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
coriolanus@69320	
coriolanus@69321	Third Citizen	Certainly
coriolanus@69345		He flouted us downright.
coriolanus@69371	
coriolanus@69372	First Citizen	No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
coriolanus@69434	
coriolanus@69435	Second Citizen	Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
coriolanus@69494		He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
coriolanus@69543		His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
coriolanus@69595	
coriolanus@69596	SICINIUS	Why, so he did, I am sure.
coriolanus@69632	
coriolanus@69633	Citizens	No, no; no man saw 'em.
coriolanus@69666	
coriolanus@69667	Third Citizen	He said he had wounds, which he could show
coriolanus@69724		in private;
coriolanus@69737		And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
coriolanus@69781		'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
coriolanus@69826		But by your voices, will not so permit me;
coriolanus@69870		Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
coriolanus@69917		Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
coriolanus@69968		Your most sweet voices: now you have left
coriolanus@70011		your voices,
coriolanus@70025		I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
coriolanus@70077	
coriolanus@70078	SICINIUS	Why either were you ignorant to see't,
coriolanus@70126		Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
coriolanus@70172		To yield your voices?
coriolanus@70195	
coriolanus@70196	BRUTUS	Could you not have told him
coriolanus@70231		As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
coriolanus@70276		But was a petty servant to the state,
coriolanus@70315		He was your enemy, ever spake against
coriolanus@70354		Your liberties and the charters that you bear
coriolanus@70401		I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
coriolanus@70445		A place of potency and sway o' the state,
coriolanus@70488		If he should still malignantly remain
coriolanus@70527		Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
coriolanus@70571		Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
coriolanus@70618		That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
coriolanus@70662		Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
coriolanus@70710		Would think upon you for your voices and
coriolanus@70752		Translate his malice towards you into love,
coriolanus@70797		Standing your friendly lord.
coriolanus@70827	
coriolanus@70828	SICINIUS	Thus to have said,
coriolanus@70856		As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
coriolanus@70906		And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
coriolanus@70951		Either his gracious promise, which you might,
coriolanus@70998		As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
coriolanus@71044		Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
coriolanus@71092		Which easily endures not article
coriolanus@71126		Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
coriolanus@71171		You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
coriolanus@71222		And pass'd him unelected.
coriolanus@71249	
coriolanus@71250	BRUTUS	Did you perceive
coriolanus@71274		He did solicit you in free contempt
coriolanus@71311		When he did need your loves, and do you think
coriolanus@71358		That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
coriolanus@71407		When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
coriolanus@71458		No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
coriolanus@71505		Against the rectorship of judgment?
coriolanus@71542	
coriolanus@71543	SICINIUS	Have you
coriolanus@71561		Ere now denied the asker? and now again
coriolanus@71602		Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
coriolanus@71645		Your sued-for tongues?
coriolanus@71669	
coriolanus@71670	Third Citizen	He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
coriolanus@71725	
coriolanus@71726	Second Citizen	And will deny him:
coriolanus@71760		I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
coriolanus@71806	
coriolanus@71807	First Citizen	I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
coriolanus@71874	
coriolanus@71875	BRUTUS	Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
coriolanus@71931		They have chose a consul that will from them take
coriolanus@71982		Their liberties; make them of no more voice
coriolanus@72027		Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
coriolanus@72073		As therefore kept to do so.
coriolanus@72102	
coriolanus@72103	SICINIUS	Let them assemble,
coriolanus@72131		And on a safer judgment all revoke
coriolanus@72167		Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
coriolanus@72211		And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
coriolanus@72259		With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
coriolanus@72304		How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
coriolanus@72353		Thinking upon his services, took from you
coriolanus@72396		The apprehension of his present portance,
coriolanus@72439		Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
coriolanus@72487		After the inveterate hate he bears you.
coriolanus@72528	
coriolanus@72529	BRUTUS	Lay
coriolanus@72540		A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
coriolanus@72589		No impediment between, but that you must
coriolanus@72631		Cast your election on him.
coriolanus@72659	
coriolanus@72660	SICINIUS	Say, you chose him
coriolanus@72688		More after our commandment than as guided
coriolanus@72731		By your own true affections, and that your minds,
coriolanus@72782		Preoccupied with what you rather must do
coriolanus@72824		Than what you should, made you against the grain
coriolanus@72874		To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
coriolanus@72917	
coriolanus@72918	BRUTUS	Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
coriolanus@72972		How youngly he began to serve his country,
coriolanus@73016		How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
coriolanus@73067		The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
coriolanus@73118		That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
coriolanus@73162		Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
coriolanus@73206		Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
coriolanus@73251		That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
coriolanus@73300		And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,
coriolanus@73337		Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,
coriolanus@73383		Was his great ancestor.
coriolanus@73408	
coriolanus@73409	SICINIUS	One thus descended,
coriolanus@73438		That hath beside well in his person wrought
coriolanus@73483		To be set high in place, we did commend
coriolanus@73524		To your remembrances: but you have found,
coriolanus@73567		Scaling his present bearing with his past,
coriolanus@73611		That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
coriolanus@73651		Your sudden approbation.
coriolanus@73677	
coriolanus@73678	BRUTUS	Say, you ne'er had done't--
coriolanus@73713		Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
coriolanus@73757		And presently, when you have drawn your number,
coriolanus@73806		Repair to the Capitol.
coriolanus@73830	
coriolanus@73831	All	We will so: almost all
coriolanus@73858		Repent in their election.
coriolanus@73885	
coriolanus@73886		[Exeunt Citizens]
coriolanus@73905	
coriolanus@73906	BRUTUS	Let them go on;
coriolanus@73929		This mutiny were better put in hazard,
coriolanus@73969		Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
coriolanus@74006		If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
coriolanus@74045		With their refusal, both observe and answer
coriolanus@74090		The vantage of his anger.
coriolanus@74117	
coriolanus@74118	SICINIUS	To the Capitol, come:
coriolanus@74149		We will be there before the stream o' the people;
coriolanus@74200		And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
coriolanus@74249		Which we have goaded onward.

coriolanus@74316	
coriolanus@74317	
coriolanus@74318	
coriolanus@74319	SCENE I	Rome. A street.
coriolanus@74343	
coriolanus@74344	
coriolanus@74345		[Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the
coriolanus@74392		Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators]
coriolanus@74446	
coriolanus@74447	CORIOLANUS	Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
coriolanus@74498	
coriolanus@74499	LARTIUS	He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
coriolanus@74553		Our swifter composition.
coriolanus@74579	
coriolanus@74580	CORIOLANUS	So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
coriolanus@74634		Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
coriolanus@74685		Upon's again.
coriolanus@74700	
coriolanus@74701	COMINIUS	They are worn, lord consul, so,
coriolanus@74742		That we shall hardly in our ages see
coriolanus@74780		Their banners wave again.
coriolanus@74807	
coriolanus@74808	CORIOLANUS	Saw you Aufidius?
coriolanus@74837	
coriolanus@74838	LARTIUS	On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
coriolanus@74889		Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
coriolanus@74934		Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
coriolanus@74978	
coriolanus@74979	CORIOLANUS	Spoke he of me?
coriolanus@75006	
coriolanus@75007	LARTIUS	                  He did, my lord.
coriolanus@75050	
coriolanus@75051	CORIOLANUS	How? what?
coriolanus@75073	
coriolanus@75074	LARTIUS	How often he had met you, sword to sword;
coriolanus@75124		That of all things upon the earth he hated
coriolanus@75168		Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
coriolanus@75219		To hopeless restitution, so he might
coriolanus@75257		Be call'd your vanquisher.
coriolanus@75285	
coriolanus@75286	CORIOLANUS	At Antium lives he?
coriolanus@75317	
coriolanus@75318	LARTIUS	At Antium.
coriolanus@75337	
coriolanus@75338	CORIOLANUS	I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
coriolanus@75389		To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
coriolanus@75432	
coriolanus@75433		[Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
coriolanus@75462	
coriolanus@75463		Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
coriolanus@75510		The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
coriolanus@75563		For they do prank them in authority,
coriolanus@75601		Against all noble sufferance.
coriolanus@75632	
coriolanus@75633	SICINIUS	Pass no further.
coriolanus@75659	
coriolanus@75660	CORIOLANUS	Ha! what is that?
coriolanus@75689	
coriolanus@75690	BRUTUS	It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
coriolanus@75740	
coriolanus@75741	CORIOLANUS	What makes this change?
coriolanus@75776	
coriolanus@75777	MENENIUS	The matter?
coriolanus@75798	
coriolanus@75799	COMINIUS	Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
coriolanus@75853	
coriolanus@75854	BRUTUS	Cominius, no.
coriolanus@75875	
coriolanus@75876	CORIOLANUS	                  Have I had children's voices?
coriolanus@75935	
coriolanus@75936	First Senator	Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
coriolanus@76000	
coriolanus@76001	BRUTUS	The people are incensed against him.
coriolanus@76045	
coriolanus@76046	SICINIUS	Stop,
coriolanus@76061		Or all will fall in broil.
coriolanus@76089	
coriolanus@76090	CORIOLANUS	Are these your herd?
coriolanus@76122		Must these have voices, that can yield them now
coriolanus@76171		And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
coriolanus@76218		your offices?
coriolanus@76233		You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
coriolanus@76288		Have you not set them on?
coriolanus@76315	
coriolanus@76316	MENENIUS	Be calm, be calm.
coriolanus@76343	
coriolanus@76344	CORIOLANUS	It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
coriolanus@76398		To curb the will of the nobility:
coriolanus@76433		Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
coriolanus@76478		Nor ever will be ruled.
coriolanus@76503	
coriolanus@76504	BRUTUS	Call't not a plot:
coriolanus@76530		The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
coriolanus@76576		When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
coriolanus@76623		Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
coriolanus@76677		Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
coriolanus@76724	
coriolanus@76725	CORIOLANUS	Why, this was known before.
coriolanus@76764	
coriolanus@76765	BRUTUS	Not to them all.
coriolanus@76789	
coriolanus@76790	CORIOLANUS	Have you inform'd them sithence?
coriolanus@76834	
coriolanus@76835	BRUTUS	How! I inform them!
coriolanus@76862	
coriolanus@76863	CORIOLANUS	You are like to do such business.
coriolanus@76908	
coriolanus@76909	BRUTUS	Not unlike,
coriolanus@76928		Each way, to better yours.
coriolanus@76956	
coriolanus@76957	CORIOLANUS	Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
coriolanus@77013		Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
coriolanus@77056		Your fellow tribune.
coriolanus@77078	
coriolanus@77079	SICINIUS	You show too much of that
coriolanus@77114		For which the people stir: if you will pass
coriolanus@77159		To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
coriolanus@77211		Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
coriolanus@77257		Or never be so noble as a consul,
coriolanus@77292		Nor yoke with him for tribune.
coriolanus@77324	
coriolanus@77325	MENENIUS	Let's be calm.
coriolanus@77349	
coriolanus@77350	COMINIUS	The people are abused; set on. This paltering
coriolanus@77405		Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
coriolanus@77443		Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
coriolanus@77491		I' the plain way of his merit.
coriolanus@77523	
coriolanus@77524	CORIOLANUS	Tell me of corn!
coriolanus@77552		This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
coriolanus@77600	
coriolanus@77601	MENENIUS	Not now, not now.
coriolanus@77628	
coriolanus@77629	First Senator	                  Not in this heat, sir, now.
coriolanus@77689	
coriolanus@77690	CORIOLANUS	Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
coriolanus@77744		I crave their pardons:
coriolanus@77768		For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
coriolanus@77814		Regard me as I do not flatter, and
coriolanus@77850		Therein behold themselves: I say again,
coriolanus@77891		In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
coriolanus@77940		The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
coriolanus@77987		Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
coriolanus@78033		and scatter'd,
coriolanus@78049		By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
coriolanus@78097		Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
coriolanus@78143		Which they have given to beggars.
coriolanus@78178	
coriolanus@78179	MENENIUS	Well, no more.
coriolanus@78203	
coriolanus@78204	First Senator	No more words, we beseech you.
coriolanus@78249	
coriolanus@78250	CORIOLANUS	How! no more!
coriolanus@78275		As for my country I have shed my blood,
coriolanus@78316		Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
coriolanus@78362		Coin words till their decay against those measles,
coriolanus@78414		Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
coriolanus@78461		The very way to catch them.
coriolanus@78490	
coriolanus@78491	BRUTUS	You speak o' the people,
coriolanus@78523		As if you were a god to punish, not
coriolanus@78560		A man of their infirmity.
coriolanus@78587	
coriolanus@78588	SICINIUS	'Twere well
coriolanus@78609		We let the people know't.
coriolanus@78636	
coriolanus@78637	MENENIUS	What, what? his choler?
coriolanus@78670	
coriolanus@78671	CORIOLANUS	Choler!
coriolanus@78690		Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
coriolanus@78732		By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
coriolanus@78762	
coriolanus@78763	SICINIUS	It is a mind
coriolanus@78785		That shall remain a poison where it is,
coriolanus@78826		Not poison any further.
coriolanus@78851	
coriolanus@78852	CORIOLANUS	Shall remain!
coriolanus@78877		Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
coriolanus@78924		His absolute 'shall'?
coriolanus@78947	
coriolanus@78948	COMINIUS	'Twas from the canon.
coriolanus@78979	
coriolanus@78980	CORIOLANUS	'Shall'!
coriolanus@79000		O good but most unwise patricians! why,
coriolanus@79041		You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
coriolanus@79089		Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
coriolanus@79129		That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
coriolanus@79174		The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
coriolanus@79229		To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
coriolanus@79273		And make your channel his? If he have power
coriolanus@79318		Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
coriolanus@79360		Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
coriolanus@79404		Be not as common fools; if you are not,
coriolanus@79445		Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
coriolanus@79496		If they be senators: and they are no less,
coriolanus@79540		When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
coriolanus@79592		Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
coriolanus@79644		And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
coriolanus@79689		His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
coriolanus@79733		Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
coriolanus@79778		It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
coriolanus@79824		To know, when two authorities are up,
coriolanus@79863		Neither supreme, how soon confusion
coriolanus@79900		May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
coriolanus@79943		The one by the other.
coriolanus@79966	
coriolanus@79967	COMINIUS	Well, on to the market-place.
coriolanus@80006	
coriolanus@80007	CORIOLANUS	Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
coriolanus@80059		The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
coriolanus@80109		Sometime in Greece,--
coriolanus@80132	
coriolanus@80133	MENENIUS	Well, well, no more of that.
coriolanus@80171	
coriolanus@80172	CORIOLANUS	Though there the people had more absolute power,
coriolanus@80232		I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
coriolanus@80273		The ruin of the state.
coriolanus@80297	
coriolanus@80298	BRUTUS	Why, shall the people give
coriolanus@80332		One that speaks thus their voice?
coriolanus@80367	
coriolanus@80368	CORIOLANUS	I'll give my reasons,
coriolanus@80401		More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
coriolanus@80454		Was not our recompense, resting well assured
coriolanus@80500		That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
coriolanus@80557		Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
coriolanus@80604		They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
coriolanus@80659		Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
coriolanus@80706		Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
coriolanus@80755		Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
coriolanus@80804		Which they have often made against the senate,
coriolanus@80852		All cause unborn, could never be the motive
coriolanus@80897		Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
coriolanus@80941		How shall this bisson multitude digest
coriolanus@80981		The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
coriolanus@81023		What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
coriolanus@81075		We are the greater poll, and in true fear
coriolanus@81118		They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
coriolanus@81161		The nature of our seats and make the rabble
coriolanus@81206		Call our cares fears; which will in time
coriolanus@81248		Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
coriolanus@81296		The crows to peck the eagles.
coriolanus@81327	
coriolanus@81328	MENENIUS	Come, enough.
coriolanus@81351	
coriolanus@81352	BRUTUS	Enough, with over-measure.
coriolanus@81386	
coriolanus@81387	CORIOLANUS	No, take more:
coriolanus@81413		What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
coriolanus@81459		Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
coriolanus@81505		Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
coriolanus@81556		Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
coriolanus@81613		Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
coriolanus@81652		Of general ignorance,--it must omit
coriolanus@81689		Real necessities, and give way the while
coriolanus@81731		To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
coriolanus@81775		it follows,
coriolanus@81788		Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
coriolanus@81843		You that will be less fearful than discreet,
coriolanus@81889		That love the fundamental part of state
coriolanus@81930		More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
coriolanus@81980		A noble life before a long, and wish
coriolanus@82018		To jump a body with a dangerous physic
coriolanus@82058		That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
coriolanus@82110		The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
coriolanus@82155		The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
coriolanus@82204		Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
coriolanus@82250		Of that integrity which should become't,
coriolanus@82292		Not having the power to do the good it would,
coriolanus@82339		For the in which doth control't.
coriolanus@82373	
coriolanus@82374	BRUTUS	Has said enough.
coriolanus@82398	
coriolanus@82399	SICINIUS	Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
coriolanus@82452		As traitors do.
coriolanus@82469	
coriolanus@82470	CORIOLANUS	                  Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
coriolanus@82536		What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
coriolanus@82589		On whom depending, their obedience fails
coriolanus@82631		To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
coriolanus@82670		When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
coriolanus@82720		Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
coriolanus@82762		Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
coriolanus@82805		And throw their power i' the dust.
coriolanus@82841	
coriolanus@82842	BRUTUS	Manifest treason!
coriolanus@82867	
coriolanus@82868	SICINIUS	                  This a consul? no.
coriolanus@82914	
coriolanus@82915	BRUTUS	The aediles, ho!
coriolanus@82939	
coriolanus@82940		[Enter an AEdile]
coriolanus@82959	
coriolanus@82960		Let him be apprehended.
coriolanus@82985	
coriolanus@82986	SICINIUS	Go, call the people:
coriolanus@83016	
coriolanus@83017		[Exit AEdile]
coriolanus@83032	
coriolanus@83033			in whose name myself
coriolanus@83056		Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
coriolanus@83096		A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
coriolanus@83144		And follow to thine answer.
coriolanus@83173	
coriolanus@83174	CORIOLANUS	Hence, old goat!
coriolanus@83202	
coriolanus@83203	Senators, &C	We'll surety him.
coriolanus@83234	
coriolanus@83235	COMINIUS	                  Aged sir, hands off.
coriolanus@83283	
coriolanus@83284	CORIOLANUS	Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
coriolanus@83343		Out of thy garments.
coriolanus@83365	
coriolanus@83366	SICINIUS	Help, ye citizens!
coriolanus@83394	
coriolanus@83395		[Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with
coriolanus@83442		the AEdiles]
coriolanus@83456	
coriolanus@83457	MENENIUS	On both sides more respect.
coriolanus@83494	
coriolanus@83495	SICINIUS	Here's he that would take from you all your power.
coriolanus@83555	
coriolanus@83556	BRUTUS	Seize him, AEdiles!
coriolanus@83583	
coriolanus@83584	Citizens	Down with him! down with him!
coriolanus@83623	
coriolanus@83624	Senators, &C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!
coriolanus@83664	
coriolanus@83665		[They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying]
coriolanus@83709	
coriolanus@83710		'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
coriolanus@83761		'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
coriolanus@83810		'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
coriolanus@83855	
coriolanus@83856	MENENIUS	What is about to be? I am out of breath;
coriolanus@83906		Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
coriolanus@83955		To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
coriolanus@83993		Speak, good Sicinius.
coriolanus@84016	
coriolanus@84017	SICINIUS	Hear me, people; peace!
coriolanus@84050	
coriolanus@84051	Citizens	Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
coriolanus@84111	
coriolanus@84112	SICINIUS	You are at point to lose your liberties:
coriolanus@84162		Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
coriolanus@84205		Whom late you have named for consul.
coriolanus@84243	
coriolanus@84244	MENENIUS	Fie, fie, fie!
coriolanus@84268		This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
coriolanus@84311	
coriolanus@84312	First Senator	To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
coriolanus@84367	
coriolanus@84368	SICINIUS	What is the city but the people?
coriolanus@84410	
coriolanus@84411	Citizens	True,
coriolanus@84426		The people are the city.
coriolanus@84452	
coriolanus@84453	BRUTUS	By the consent of all, we were establish'd
coriolanus@84503		The people's magistrates.
coriolanus@84530	
coriolanus@84531	Citizens	You so remain.
coriolanus@84555	
coriolanus@84556	MENENIUS	And so are like to do.
coriolanus@84588	
coriolanus@84589	COMINIUS	That is the way to lay the city flat;
coriolanus@84636		To bring the roof to the foundation,
coriolanus@84674		And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
coriolanus@84718		In heaps and piles of ruin.
coriolanus@84747	
coriolanus@84748	SICINIUS	This deserves death.
coriolanus@84778	
coriolanus@84779	BRUTUS	Or let us stand to our authority,
coriolanus@84820		Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
coriolanus@84862		Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
coriolanus@84907		We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
coriolanus@84950		Of present death.
coriolanus@84969	
coriolanus@84970	SICINIUS	                  Therefore lay hold of him;
coriolanus@85024		Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
coriolanus@85072		Into destruction cast him.
coriolanus@85100	
coriolanus@85101	BRUTUS	AEdiles, seize him!
coriolanus@85128	
coriolanus@85129	Citizens	Yield, Marcius, yield!
coriolanus@85161	
coriolanus@85162	MENENIUS	Hear me one word;
coriolanus@85189		Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
coriolanus@85233	
coriolanus@85234	AEdile	Peace, peace!
coriolanus@85255	
coriolanus@85256	MENENIUS	[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly your
coriolanus@85307		country's friend,
coriolanus@85326		And temperately proceed to what you would
coriolanus@85369		Thus violently redress.
coriolanus@85394	
coriolanus@85395	BRUTUS	Sir, those cold ways,
coriolanus@85424		That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
coriolanus@85474		Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
coriolanus@85525		And bear him to the rock.
coriolanus@85552	
coriolanus@85553	CORIOLANUS	No, I'll die here.
coriolanus@85583	
coriolanus@85584		[Drawing his sword]
coriolanus@85605	
coriolanus@85606		There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
coriolanus@85655		Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
coriolanus@85705	
coriolanus@85706	MENENIUS	Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
coriolanus@85764	
coriolanus@85765	BRUTUS	Lay hands upon him.
coriolanus@85792	
coriolanus@85793	COMINIUS	Help Marcius, help,
coriolanus@85822		You that be noble; help him, young and old!
coriolanus@85867	
coriolanus@85868	Citizens	Down with him, down with him!
coriolanus@85907	
coriolanus@85908		[In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the
coriolanus@85961		People, are beat in]
coriolanus@85983	
coriolanus@85984	MENENIUS	Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
coriolanus@86035		All will be naught else.
coriolanus@86061	
coriolanus@86062	Second Senator	Get you gone.
coriolanus@86091	
coriolanus@86092	COMINIUS	Stand fast;
coriolanus@86113		We have as many friends as enemies.
coriolanus@86150	
coriolanus@86151	MENENIUS	Sham it be put to that?
coriolanus@86184	
coriolanus@86185	First Senator	The gods forbid!
coriolanus@86216		I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
coriolanus@86261		Leave us to cure this cause.
coriolanus@86291	
coriolanus@86292	MENENIUS	For 'tis a sore upon us,
coriolanus@86326		You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
coriolanus@86375	
coriolanus@86376	COMINIUS	Come, sir, along with us.
coriolanus@86411	
coriolanus@86412	CORIOLANUS	I would they were barbarians--as they are,
coriolanus@86466		Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
coriolanus@86521		Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
coriolanus@86566	
coriolanus@86567	MENENIUS	Be gone;
coriolanus@86585		Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
coriolanus@86629		One time will owe another.
coriolanus@86657	
coriolanus@86658	CORIOLANUS	On fair ground
coriolanus@86684		I could beat forty of them.
coriolanus@86713	
coriolanus@86714	COMINIUS	I could myself
coriolanus@86738		Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
coriolanus@86785		two tribunes:
coriolanus@86800		But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
coriolanus@86838		And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
coriolanus@86885		Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
coriolanus@86928		Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
coriolanus@86973		Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
coriolanus@87011		What they are used to bear.
coriolanus@87040	
coriolanus@87041	MENENIUS	Pray you, be gone:
coriolanus@87069		I'll try whether my old wit be in request
coriolanus@87112		With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
coriolanus@87167		With cloth of any colour.
coriolanus@87194	
coriolanus@87195	COMINIUS	Nay, come away.
coriolanus@87220	
coriolanus@87221		[Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others]
coriolanus@87264	
coriolanus@87265	A Patrician	This man has marr'd his fortune.
coriolanus@87310	
coriolanus@87311	MENENIUS	His nature is too noble for the world:
coriolanus@87359		He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
coriolanus@87406		Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
coriolanus@87462		What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
coriolanus@87514		And, being angry, does forget that ever
coriolanus@87555		He heard the name of death.
coriolanus@87584	
coriolanus@87585		[A noise within]
coriolanus@87603	
coriolanus@87604			      Here's goodly work!
coriolanus@87632	
coriolanus@87633	Second Patrician	I would they were abed!
coriolanus@87674	
coriolanus@87675	MENENIUS	I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
coriolanus@87732		Could he not speak 'em fair?
coriolanus@87762	
coriolanus@87763		[Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble]
coriolanus@87812	
coriolanus@87813	SICINIUS	Where is this viper
coriolanus@87842		That would depopulate the city and
coriolanus@87878		Be every man himself?
coriolanus@87901	
coriolanus@87902	MENENIUS	You worthy tribunes,--
coriolanus@87934	
coriolanus@87935	SICINIUS	He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
coriolanus@87986		With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
coriolanus@88030		And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
coriolanus@88079		Than the severity of the public power
coriolanus@88118		Which he so sets at nought.
coriolanus@88147	
coriolanus@88148	First Citizen	He shall well know
coriolanus@88181		The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
coriolanus@88226		And we their hands.
coriolanus@88247	
coriolanus@88248	Citizens	He shall, sure on't.
coriolanus@88278	
coriolanus@88279	MENENIUS	Sir, sir,--
coriolanus@88300	
coriolanus@88301	SICINIUS	Peace!
coriolanus@88317	
coriolanus@88318	MENENIUS	Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
coriolanus@88371		With modest warrant.
coriolanus@88393	
coriolanus@88394	SICINIUS	Sir, how comes't that you
coriolanus@88429		Have holp to make this rescue?
coriolanus@88461	
coriolanus@88462	MENENIUS	Hear me speak:
coriolanus@88486		As I do know the consul's worthiness,
coriolanus@88525		So can I name his faults,--
coriolanus@88554	
coriolanus@88555	SICINIUS	Consul! what consul?
coriolanus@88585	
coriolanus@88586	MENENIUS	The consul Coriolanus.
coriolanus@88618	
coriolanus@88619	BRUTUS	He consul!
coriolanus@88637	
coriolanus@88638	Citizens	No, no, no, no, no.
coriolanus@88667	
coriolanus@88668	MENENIUS	If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
coriolanus@88729		I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
coriolanus@88775		The which shall turn you to no further harm
coriolanus@88820		Than so much loss of time.
coriolanus@88848	
coriolanus@88849	SICINIUS	Speak briefly then;
coriolanus@88878		For we are peremptory to dispatch
coriolanus@88913		This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
coriolanus@88956		Were but one danger, and to keep him here
coriolanus@88999		Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
coriolanus@89043		He dies to-night.
coriolanus@89062	
coriolanus@89063	MENENIUS	                  Now the good gods forbid
coriolanus@89115		That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
coriolanus@89156		Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
coriolanus@89199		In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
coriolanus@89242		Should now eat up her own!
coriolanus@89270	
coriolanus@89271	SICINIUS	He's a disease that must be cut away.
coriolanus@89318	
coriolanus@89319	MENENIUS	O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
coriolanus@89367		Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
coriolanus@89409		What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
coriolanus@89456		Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
coriolanus@89503		Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
coriolanus@89552		By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
coriolanus@89602		And what is left, to lose it by his country,
coriolanus@89648		Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
coriolanus@89690		A brand to the end o' the world.
coriolanus@89724	
coriolanus@89725	SICINIUS	This is clean kam.
coriolanus@89753	
coriolanus@89754	BRUTUS	Merely awry: when he did love his country,
coriolanus@89804		It honour'd him.
coriolanus@89822	
coriolanus@89823	MENENIUS	                  The service of the foot
coriolanus@89874		Being once gangrened, is not then respected
coriolanus@89919		For what before it was.
coriolanus@89944	
coriolanus@89945	BRUTUS	We'll hear no more.
coriolanus@89972		Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
coriolanus@90020		Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
coriolanus@90067		Spread further.
coriolanus@90084	
coriolanus@90085	MENENIUS	                  One word more, one word.
coriolanus@90137		This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
coriolanus@90181		The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
coriolanus@90229		Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
coriolanus@90280		Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
coriolanus@90324		And sack great Rome with Romans.
coriolanus@90358	
coriolanus@90359	BRUTUS	If it were so,--
coriolanus@90383	
coriolanus@90384	SICINIUS	What do ye talk?
coriolanus@90410		Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
coriolanus@90453		Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
coriolanus@90499	
coriolanus@90500	MENENIUS	Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
coriolanus@90553		Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
coriolanus@90603		In bolted language; meal and bran together
coriolanus@90647		He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
coriolanus@90694		I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
coriolanus@90738		Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
coriolanus@90780		In peace, to his utmost peril.
coriolanus@90812	
coriolanus@90813	First Senator	Noble tribunes,
coriolanus@90843		It is the humane way: the other course
coriolanus@90883		Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
coriolanus@90925		Unknown to the beginning.
coriolanus@90952	
coriolanus@90953	SICINIUS	Noble Menenius,
coriolanus@90978		Be you then as the people's officer.
coriolanus@91016		Masters, lay down your weapons.
coriolanus@91049	
coriolanus@91050	BRUTUS	Go not home.

coriolanus@91071	SICINIUS	Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
coriolanus@91130		Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
coriolanus@91178		In our first way.
coriolanus@91197	
coriolanus@91198	MENENIUS	                  I'll bring him to you.
coriolanus@91248	
coriolanus@91249		[To the Senators]
coriolanus@91268	
coriolanus@91269		Let me desire your company: he must come,
coriolanus@91312		Or what is worst will follow.
coriolanus@91343	
coriolanus@91344	First Senator	Pray you, let's to him.

coriolanus@91420	
coriolanus@91421	
coriolanus@91422	SCENE II	A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.
coriolanus@91461	
coriolanus@91462	
coriolanus@91463		[Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians]
coriolanus@91499	
coriolanus@91500	CORIOLANUS	Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
coriolanus@91557		Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
coriolanus@91603		Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
coriolanus@91644		That the precipitation might down stretch
coriolanus@91687		Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
coriolanus@91730		Be thus to them.
coriolanus@91748	
coriolanus@91749	A Patrician	You do the nobler.
coriolanus@91780	
coriolanus@91781	CORIOLANUS	I muse my mother
coriolanus@91809		Does not approve me further, who was wont
coriolanus@91852		To call them woollen vassals, things created
coriolanus@91898		To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
coriolanus@91947		In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
coriolanus@91996		When one but of my ordinance stood up
coriolanus@92035		To speak of peace or war.
coriolanus@92062	
coriolanus@92063		[Enter VOLUMNIA]
coriolanus@92081	
coriolanus@92082			    I talk of you:
coriolanus@92103		Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
coriolanus@92150		False to my nature? Rather say I play
coriolanus@92189		The man I am.
coriolanus@92204	
coriolanus@92205	VOLUMNIA	                  O, sir, sir, sir,
coriolanus@92250		I would have had you put your power well on,
coriolanus@92296		Before you had worn it out.
coriolanus@92325	
coriolanus@92326	CORIOLANUS	Let go.
coriolanus@92345	
coriolanus@92346	VOLUMNIA	You might have been enough the man you are,
coriolanus@92399		With striving less to be so; lesser had been
coriolanus@92445		The thwartings of your dispositions, if
coriolanus@92486		You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
coriolanus@92532		Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
coriolanus@92569	
coriolanus@92570	CORIOLANUS	Let them hang.
coriolanus@92596	
coriolanus@92597	A Patrician	Ay, and burn too.
coriolanus@92627	
coriolanus@92628		[Enter MENENIUS and Senators]
coriolanus@92659	
coriolanus@92660	MENENIUS	Come, come, you have been too rough, something
coriolanus@92716		too rough;
coriolanus@92728		You must return and mend it.
coriolanus@92758	
coriolanus@92759	First Senator	There's no remedy;
coriolanus@92792		Unless, by not so doing, our good city
coriolanus@92832		Cleave in the midst, and perish.
coriolanus@92866	
coriolanus@92867	VOLUMNIA	Pray, be counsell'd:
coriolanus@92897		I have a heart as little apt as yours,
coriolanus@92937		But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
coriolanus@92981		To better vantage.
coriolanus@93001	
coriolanus@93002	MENENIUS	                  Well said, noble woman?
coriolanus@93053		Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
coriolanus@93104		The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
coriolanus@93153		For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
coriolanus@93203		Which I can scarcely bear.
coriolanus@93231	
coriolanus@93232	CORIOLANUS	What must I do?
coriolanus@93259	
coriolanus@93260	MENENIUS	Return to the tribunes.
coriolanus@93293	
coriolanus@93294	CORIOLANUS	Well, what then? what then?
coriolanus@93333	
coriolanus@93334	MENENIUS	Repent what you have spoke.
coriolanus@93371	
coriolanus@93372	CORIOLANUS	For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
coriolanus@93421		Must I then do't to them?
coriolanus@93448	
coriolanus@93449	VOLUMNIA	You are too absolute;
coriolanus@93480		Though therein you can never be too noble,
coriolanus@93524		But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
coriolanus@93575		Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
coriolanus@93619		I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
coriolanus@93674		In peace what each of them by the other lose,
coriolanus@93721		That they combine not there.
coriolanus@93751	
coriolanus@93752	CORIOLANUS	Tush, tush!
coriolanus@93775	
coriolanus@93776	MENENIUS	A good demand.
coriolanus@93800	
coriolanus@93801	VOLUMNIA	If it be honour in your wars to seem
coriolanus@93847		The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
coriolanus@93897		You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
coriolanus@93946		That it shall hold companionship in peace
coriolanus@93989		With honour, as in war, since that to both
coriolanus@94033		It stands in like request?
coriolanus@94061	
coriolanus@94062	CORIOLANUS	Why force you this?
coriolanus@94093	
coriolanus@94094	VOLUMNIA	Because that now it lies you on to speak
coriolanus@94144		To the people; not by your own instruction,
coriolanus@94189		Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
coriolanus@94238		But with such words that are but rooted in
coriolanus@94282		Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
coriolanus@94330		Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
coriolanus@94370		Now, this no more dishonours you at all
coriolanus@94411		Than to take in a town with gentle words,
coriolanus@94454		Which else would put you to your fortune and
coriolanus@94500		The hazard of much blood.
coriolanus@94527		I would dissemble with my nature where
coriolanus@94567		My fortunes and my friends at stake required
coriolanus@94613		I should do so in honour: I am in this,
coriolanus@94654		Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
coriolanus@94704		And you will rather show our general louts
coriolanus@94748		How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
coriolanus@94795		For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
coriolanus@94845		Of what that want might ruin.
coriolanus@94876	
coriolanus@94877	MENENIUS	Noble lady!
coriolanus@94898		Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
coriolanus@94947		Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
coriolanus@94992		Of what is past.
coriolanus@95010	
coriolanus@95011	VOLUMNIA	                  I prithee now, my son,
coriolanus@95061		Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
coriolanus@95104		And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
coriolanus@95159		Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
coriolanus@95210		Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
coriolanus@95261		More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
coriolanus@95307		Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
coriolanus@95355		Now humble as the ripest mulberry
coriolanus@95390		That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
coriolanus@95440		Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
coriolanus@95490		Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
coriolanus@95539		Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
coriolanus@95583		In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
coriolanus@95632		Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
coriolanus@95677		As thou hast power and person.
coriolanus@95709	
coriolanus@95710	MENENIUS	This but done,
coriolanus@95734		Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
coriolanus@95785		For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
coriolanus@95830		As words to little purpose.
coriolanus@95859	
coriolanus@95860	VOLUMNIA	Prithee now,
coriolanus@95882		Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
coriolanus@95935		Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
coriolanus@95971		Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
coriolanus@96019	
coriolanus@96020		[Enter COMINIUS]
coriolanus@96038	
coriolanus@96039	COMINIUS	I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
coriolanus@96099		You make strong party, or defend yourself
coriolanus@96142		By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
coriolanus@96186	
coriolanus@96187	MENENIUS	Only fair speech.
coriolanus@96214	
coriolanus@96215	COMINIUS	                  I think 'twill serve, if he
coriolanus@96270		Can thereto frame his spirit.
coriolanus@96301	
coriolanus@96302	VOLUMNIA	He must, and will
coriolanus@96329		Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
coriolanus@96374	
coriolanus@96375	CORIOLANUS	Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
coriolanus@96426		Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
coriolanus@96471		A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
coriolanus@96516		Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
coriolanus@96563		This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
coriolanus@96616		And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
coriolanus@96668		You have put me now to such a part which never
coriolanus@96716		I shall discharge to the life.
coriolanus@96748	
coriolanus@96749	COMINIUS	Come, come, we'll prompt you.
coriolanus@96788	
coriolanus@96789	VOLUMNIA	I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
coriolanus@96842		My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
coriolanus@96885		To have my praise for this, perform a part
coriolanus@96929		Thou hast not done before.
coriolanus@96957	
coriolanus@96958	CORIOLANUS	Well, I must do't:
coriolanus@96988		Away, my disposition, and possess me
coriolanus@97026		Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
coriolanus@97077		Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
coriolanus@97117		Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
coriolanus@97158		That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
coriolanus@97206		Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
coriolanus@97256		The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
coriolanus@97300		Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
coriolanus@97350		Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
coriolanus@97394		That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
coriolanus@97440		Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
coriolanus@97482		And by my body's action teach my mind
coriolanus@97521		A most inherent baseness.
coriolanus@97548	
coriolanus@97549	VOLUMNIA	At thy choice, then:
coriolanus@97579		To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
coriolanus@97620		Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
coriolanus@97662		Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
coriolanus@97706		Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
coriolanus@97752		With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
coriolanus@97796		Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
coriolanus@97849		But owe thy pride thyself.
coriolanus@97877	
coriolanus@97878	CORIOLANUS	Pray, be content:
coriolanus@97907		Mother, I am going to the market-place;
coriolanus@97948		Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
coriolanus@97996		Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
coriolanus@98047		Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
coriolanus@98093		Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
coriolanus@98137		Or never trust to what my tongue can do
coriolanus@98178		I' the way of flattery further.
coriolanus@98211	
coriolanus@98212	VOLUMNIA	Do your will.
coriolanus@98235	
coriolanus@98236		[Exit]
coriolanus@98244	
coriolanus@98245	COMINIUS	Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
coriolanus@98301		To answer mildly; for they are prepared
coriolanus@98342		With accusations, as I hear, more strong
coriolanus@98384		Than are upon you yet.
coriolanus@98408	
coriolanus@98409	CORIOLANUS	The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
coriolanus@98463		Let them accuse me by invention, I
coriolanus@98499		Will answer in mine honour.
coriolanus@98528	
coriolanus@98529	MENENIUS	Ay, but mildly.
coriolanus@98554	
coriolanus@98555	CORIOLANUS	Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

coriolanus@98701	
coriolanus@98702	BRUTUS	In this point charge him home, that he affects
coriolanus@98756		Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
coriolanus@98797		Enforce him with his envy to the people,
coriolanus@98839		And that the spoil got on the Antiates
coriolanus@98879		Was ne'er distributed.
coriolanus@98903	
coriolanus@98904		[Enter an AEdile]
coriolanus@98923

coriolanus@98992	AEdile	With old Menenius, and those senators
coriolanus@99037		That always favour'd him.
coriolanus@99064	
coriolanus@99065	SICINIUS	Have you a catalogue
coriolanus@99095		Of all the voices that we have procured
coriolanus@99136		Set down by the poll?
coriolanus@99159	
coriolanus@99160	AEdile	I have; 'tis ready.
coriolanus@99187	
coriolanus@99188	SICINIUS	Have you collected them by tribes?
coriolanus@99232	
coriolanus@99233	AEdile	I have.
coriolanus@99248	
coriolanus@99249	SICINIUS	Assemble presently the people hither;
coriolanus@99296		And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
coriolanus@99339		I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
coriolanus@99396		For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
coriolanus@99447		If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
coriolanus@99498		Insisting on the old prerogative
coriolanus@99532		And power i' the truth o' the cause.
coriolanus@99570	
coriolanus@99571	AEdile	I shall inform them.
coriolanus@99599	
coriolanus@99600	BRUTUS	And when such time they have begun to cry,
coriolanus@99650		Let them not cease, but with a din confused

coriolanus@99777

coriolanus@99890		[Exit AEdile]
coriolanus@99905	
coriolanus@99906		Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
coriolanus@99953		Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
coriolanus@99993		Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
coriolanus@100041		Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
coriolanus@100088		What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
coriolanus@100140		With us to break his neck.

coriolanus@101108	CORIOLANUS	I am content.
coriolanus@101133	
coriolanus@101134	MENENIUS	Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
coriolanus@101180		The warlike service he has done, consider; think
coriolanus@101230		Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
coriolanus@101274		Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
coriolanus@101311	
coriolanus@101312	CORIOLANUS	Scratches with briers,
coriolanus@101346		Scars to move laughter only.
coriolanus@101376	
coriolanus@101377	MENENIUS	Consider further,
coriolanus@101404		That when he speaks not like a citizen,
coriolanus@101445		You find him like a soldier: do not take
coriolanus@101487		His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
coriolanus@101530		But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
coriolanus@101572		Rather than envy you.
coriolanus@101595	
coriolanus@101596	COMINIUS	Well, well, no more.
coriolanus@101626	
coriolanus@101627	CORIOLANUS	What is the matter
coriolanus@101657		That being pass'd for consul with full voice,

coriolanus@101769	SICINIUS	Answer to us.
coriolanus@101792	
coriolanus@101793	CORIOLANUS	Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
coriolanus@101838	
coriolanus@101839	SICINIUS	We charge you, that you have contrived to take
coriolanus@101895		From Rome all season'd office and to wind
coriolanus@101938		Yourself into a power tyrannical;
coriolanus@101973		For which you are a traitor to the people.

coriolanus@102164		Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
coriolanus@102212		Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
coriolanus@102259		In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
coriolanus@102302		Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
coriolanus@102346		'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
coriolanus@102391		As I do pray the gods.

coriolanus@102510		We need not put new matter to his charge:
coriolanus@102553		What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
coriolanus@102601		Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
coriolanus@102645		Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
coriolanus@102690		Those whose great power must try him; even this,
coriolanus@102740		So criminal and in such capital kind,
coriolanus@102779		Deserves the extremest death.
coriolanus@102810	
coriolanus@102811	BRUTUS	But since he hath

coriolanus@102861

coriolanus@103016	COMINIUS	Know, I pray you,--
coriolanus@103045	
coriolanus@103046	CORIOLANUS	I know no further:
coriolanus@103076		Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
coriolanus@103122		Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
coriolanus@103162		But with a grain a day, I would not buy
coriolanus@103203		Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
coriolanus@103247		Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
coriolanus@103294		To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
coriolanus@103332	
coriolanus@103333	SICINIUS	For that he has,
coriolanus@103359		As much as in him lies, from time to time
coriolanus@103402		Envied against the people, seeking means
coriolanus@103444		To pluck away their power, as now at last
coriolanus@103487		Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
coriolanus@103540		Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
coriolanus@103582		That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
coriolanus@103632		And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
coriolanus@103674		Even from this instant, banish him our city,
coriolanus@103720		In peril of precipitation
coriolanus@103747		From off the rock Tarpeian never more
coriolanus@103786		To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
coriolanus@103834		I say it shall be so.

coriolanus@104048

coriolanus@104072		I have been consul, and can show for Rome
coriolanus@104115		Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
coriolanus@104154		My country's good with a respect more tender,
coriolanus@104201		More holy and profound, than mine own life,
coriolanus@104246		My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
coriolanus@104293		And treasure of my loins; then if I would
coriolanus@104336		Speak that,--

coriolanus@104352	SICINIUS	                  We know your drift: speak what?
coriolanus@104411	
coriolanus@104412	BRUTUS	There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,

coriolanus@104711		That do corrupt my air, I banish you;

coriolanus@105052		Still your own foes, deliver you as most

coriolanus@106893		Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
coriolanus@106937		And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
coriolanus@106987		I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld

coriolanus@112522		so to heart the banishment of that worthy
coriolanus@112565		Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
coriolanus@112618		all power from the people and to pluck from them
coriolanus@112668		their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
coriolanus@112719		tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
coriolanus@112767		breaking out.
coriolanus@112782	
coriolanus@112783	Volsce	Coriolanus banished!
coriolanus@112811	
coriolanus@112812	Roman	Banished, sir.
coriolanus@112833	
coriolanus@112834	Volsce	You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
coriolanus@112894	
coriolanus@112895	Roman	The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
coriolanus@112951		said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
coriolanus@113002		when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
coriolanus@113054		Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
coriolanus@113107		great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
coriolanus@113159		of his country.
coriolanus@113176	
coriolanus@113177	Volsce	He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
coriolanus@113228		accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
coriolanus@113278		business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
coriolanus@113328	
coriolanus@113329	Roman	I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
coriolanus@113383		strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
coriolanus@113437		their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
coriolanus@113490	
coriolanus@113491	Volsce	A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
coriolanus@113550		distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
coriolanus@113602		and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
coriolanus@113643	
coriolanus@113644	Roman	I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
coriolanus@113701		man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
coriolanus@113755		So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
coriolanus@113815	
coriolanus@113816	Volsce	You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
coriolanus@113876		to be glad of yours.
coriolanus@113898	
coriolanus@113899	Roman	Well, let us go together.

coriolanus@118215	
coriolanus@118216	AUFIDIUS	What is thy name?
coriolanus@118243	
coriolanus@118244	CORIOLANUS	A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
coriolanus@118296		And harsh in sound to thine.
coriolanus@118326	
coriolanus@118327	AUFIDIUS	Say, what's thy name?
coriolanus@118358		Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
coriolanus@118401		Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
coriolanus@118450		Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
coriolanus@118497

coriolanus@118559	AUFIDIUS	I know thee not: thy name?
coriolanus@118595	
coriolanus@118596	CORIOLANUS	My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
coriolanus@118647		To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
coriolanus@118692		Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
coriolanus@118738		My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
coriolanus@118784		The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
coriolanus@118828		Shed for my thankless country are requited
coriolanus@118872		But with that surname; a good memory,
coriolanus@118911		And witness of the malice and displeasure
coriolanus@118954		Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
coriolanus@119008		The cruelty and envy of the people,
coriolanus@119045		Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
coriolanus@119083		Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
coriolanus@119129		And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
coriolanus@119175		Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
coriolanus@119216		Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
coriolanus@119266		Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
coriolanus@119307		I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
coriolanus@119356		I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
coriolanus@119403		To be full quit of those my banishers,
coriolanus@119443		Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
coriolanus@119488		A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
coriolanus@119533		Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
coriolanus@119583		Of shame seen through thy country, speed
coriolanus@119625		thee straight,
coriolanus@119641		And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
coriolanus@119687		That my revengeful services may prove
coriolanus@119726		As benefits to thee, for I will fight
coriolanus@119765		Against my canker'd country with the spleen
coriolanus@119810		Of all the under fiends. But if so be
coriolanus@119849		Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
coriolanus@119903		Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
coriolanus@119946		Longer to live most weary, and present
coriolanus@119986		My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
coriolanus@120032		Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
coriolanus@120078		Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
coriolanus@120122		Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
coriolanus@120172		And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
coriolanus@120214		It be to do thee service.
coriolanus@120241	
coriolanus@120242	AUFIDIUS	O Marcius, Marcius!
coriolanus@120271		Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
coriolanus@120324		A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
coriolanus@120360		Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
coriolanus@120405		And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
coriolanus@120453		Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
coriolanus@120497		Mine arms about that body, where against
coriolanus@120539		My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
coriolanus@120583		And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
coriolanus@120633		The anvil of my sword, and do contest
coriolanus@120672		As hotly and as nobly with thy love
coriolanus@120709		As ever in ambitious strength I did
coriolanus@120746		Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
coriolanus@120792		I loved the maid I married; never man
coriolanus@120831		Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
coriolanus@120879		Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
coriolanus@120924		Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
coriolanus@120966		Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
coriolanus@121019		We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
coriolanus@121063		Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
coriolanus@121108		Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
coriolanus@121154		Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
coriolanus@121202		Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
coriolanus@121247		We have been down together in my sleep,
coriolanus@121288		Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
coriolanus@121336		And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
coriolanus@121387		Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
coriolanus@121429		Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
coriolanus@121476		From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
coriolanus@121517		Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
coriolanus@121554		Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
coriolanus@121600		And take our friendly senators by the hands;
coriolanus@121646		Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
coriolanus@121692		Who am prepared against your territories,
coriolanus@121735		Though not for Rome itself.
coriolanus@121764	
coriolanus@121765	CORIOLANUS	You bless me, gods!
coriolanus@121796	
coriolanus@121797	AUFIDIUS	Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
coriolanus@121854		The leading of thine own revenges, take
coriolanus@121895		The one half of my commission; and set down--
coriolanus@121942		As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
coriolanus@121992		Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
coriolanus@122047		Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
coriolanus@122092		Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
coriolanus@122131		To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
coriolanus@122174		Let me commend thee first to those that shall
coriolanus@122221		Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
coriolanus@122267		And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
coriolanus@122306		Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
coriolanus@122361	
coriolanus@122362		[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two
coriolanus@122404		Servingmen come forward]
coriolanus@122430	
coriolanus@122431	First Servingman	Here's a strange alteration!
coriolanus@122477	
coriolanus@122478	Second Servingman	By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
coriolanus@122548		a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
coriolanus@122602		false report of him.
coriolanus@122624	
coriolanus@122625	First Servingman	What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
coriolanus@122690		finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
coriolanus@122740	
coriolanus@122741	Second Servingman	Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
coriolanus@122811		him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
coriolanus@122860		cannot tell how to term it.
coriolanus@122889	
coriolanus@122890	First Servingman	He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
coriolanus@122959		but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
coriolanus@123016	
coriolanus@123017	Second Servingman	So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
coriolanus@123084		man i' the world.
coriolanus@123103	
coriolanus@123104	First Servingman	I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
coriolanus@123178	
coriolanus@123179	Second Servingman	Who, my master?
coriolanus@123213	
coriolanus@123214	First Servingman	Nay, it's no matter for that.
coriolanus@123261	
coriolanus@123262	Second Servingman	Worth six on him.
coriolanus@123298	
coriolanus@123299	First Servingman	Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
coriolanus@123362		greater soldier.
coriolanus@123380	
coriolanus@123381	Second Servingman	Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
coriolanus@123449		for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
coriolanus@123503	
coriolanus@123504	First Servingman	Ay, and for an assault too.
coriolanus@123549	
coriolanus@123550		[Re-enter third Servingman]
coriolanus@123579	
coriolanus@123580	Third Servingman	O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

coriolanus@123650	
coriolanus@123651	First Servingman	|
coriolanus@123670		|  What, what, what? let's partake.
coriolanus@123707	Second Servingman	|
coriolanus@123727	
coriolanus@123728	
coriolanus@123729	Third Servingman	I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
coriolanus@123795		lieve be a condemned man.
coriolanus@123822	
coriolanus@123823	
coriolanus@123824	First Servingman	|
coriolanus@123843		|  Wherefore? wherefore?
coriolanus@123869	Second Servingman	|
coriolanus@123889	
coriolanus@123890	
coriolanus@123891	Third Servingman	Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
coriolanus@123960		Caius Marcius.
coriolanus@123976	
coriolanus@123977	First Servingman	Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
coriolanus@124032	
coriolanus@124033	Third Servingman	I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
coriolanus@124103		good enough for him.
coriolanus@124125	
coriolanus@124126	Second Servingman	Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
coriolanus@124194		hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
coriolanus@124242	
coriolanus@124243	First Servingman	He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
coriolanus@124311		on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
coriolanus@124361		him like a carbon ado.
coriolanus@124385	
coriolanus@124386	Second Servingman	An he had been cannibally given, he might have
coriolanus@124451		broiled and eaten him too.
coriolanus@124479	
coriolanus@124480	First Servingman	But, more of thy news?
coriolanus@124520	
coriolanus@124521	Third Servingman	Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
coriolanus@124591		and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
coriolanus@124644		question asked him by any of the senators, but they
coriolanus@124697		stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
coriolanus@124749		mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
coriolanus@124802		turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
coriolanus@124855		the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
coriolanus@124909		the middle and but one half of what he was
coriolanus@124953		yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
coriolanus@125005		and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
coriolanus@125055		and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
coriolanus@125106		will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.
coriolanus@125167	
coriolanus@125168	Second Servingman	And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
coriolanus@125237	
coriolanus@125238	Third Servingman	Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
coriolanus@125305		many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
coriolanus@125357		were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
coriolanus@125410		we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.
coriolanus@125463	
coriolanus@125464	First Servingman	Directitude! what's that?
coriolanus@125507	
coriolanus@125508	Third Servingman	But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
coriolanus@125575		and the man in blood, they will out of their
coriolanus@125621		burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
coriolanus@125674		him.
coriolanus@125680	
coriolanus@125681	First Servingman	But when goes this forward?
coriolanus@125726	
coriolanus@125727	Third Servingman	To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
coriolanus@125793		drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
coriolanus@125845		parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
coriolanus@125897		wipe their lips.
coriolanus@125915	
coriolanus@125916	Second Servingman	Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
coriolanus@125982		This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
coriolanus@126033		tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
coriolanus@126068	
coriolanus@126069	First Servingman	Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
coriolanus@126137		day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
coriolanus@126190		full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
coriolanus@126241		mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
coriolanus@126293		bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
coriolanus@126342	
coriolanus@126343	Second Servingman	'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
coriolanus@126411		be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
coriolanus@126465		great maker of cuckolds.
coriolanus@126491	
coriolanus@126492	First Servingman	Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
coriolanus@126548	
coriolanus@126549	Third Servingman	Reason; because they then less need one another.
coriolanus@126615		The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
coriolanus@126669		as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
coriolanus@126718

coriolanus@126840	
coriolanus@126841	SICINIUS	We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
coriolanus@126896		His remedies are tame i' the present peace
coriolanus@126940		And quietness of the people, which before
coriolanus@126983		Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
coriolanus@127032		Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
coriolanus@127081		Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
coriolanus@127129		Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
coriolanus@127177		Our tradesmen with in their shops and going

coriolanus@127460	SICINIUS	Your Coriolanus
coriolanus@127485		Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
coriolanus@127528		The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
coriolanus@127575		Were he more angry at it.
coriolanus@127602	
coriolanus@127603	MENENIUS	All's well; and might have been much better, if
coriolanus@127660		He could have temporized.
coriolanus@127687	
coriolanus@127688	SICINIUS	Where is he, hear you?
coriolanus@127720	
coriolanus@127721	MENENIUS	Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife

coriolanus@128365	
coriolanus@128366	BRUTUS	                  Caius Marcius was
coriolanus@128409		A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
coriolanus@128453		O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
coriolanus@128504		Self-loving,--
coriolanus@128520	
coriolanus@128521	SICINIUS	                  And affecting one sole throne,
coriolanus@128579		Without assistance.
coriolanus@128600	
coriolanus@128601	MENENIUS	I think not so.
coriolanus@128626	
coriolanus@128627	SICINIUS	We should by this, to all our lamentation,
coriolanus@128679		If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

coriolanus@128898		Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
coriolanus@128944		Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
coriolanus@128983		And with the deepest malice of the war
coriolanus@129023		Destroy what lies before 'em.
coriolanus@129054	
coriolanus@129055	MENENIUS	'Tis Aufidius,
coriolanus@129079		Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
coriolanus@129121		Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
coriolanus@129168		Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
coriolanus@129219		And durst not once peep out.
coriolanus@129249	
coriolanus@129250	SICINIUS	Come, what talk you
coriolanus@129279		Of Marcius?
coriolanus@129292	
coriolanus@129293	BRUTUS	Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
coriolanus@129343		The Volsces dare break with us.
coriolanus@129376	
coriolanus@129377	MENENIUS	Cannot be!
coriolanus@129397		We have record that very well it can,
coriolanus@129436		And three examples of the like have been
coriolanus@129478		Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
coriolanus@129522		Before you punish him, where he heard this,
coriolanus@129567		Lest you shall chance to whip your information
coriolanus@129615		And beat the messenger who bids beware
coriolanus@129655		Of what is to be dreaded.
coriolanus@129682	
coriolanus@129683	SICINIUS	Tell not me:
coriolanus@129705		I know this cannot be.
coriolanus@129729	
coriolanus@129730	BRUTUS	Not possible.

coriolanus@129774	Messenger	The nobles in great earnestness are going
coriolanus@129826		All to the senate-house: some news is come
coriolanus@129870		That turns their countenances.
coriolanus@129902	
coriolanus@129903	SICINIUS	'Tis this slave;--
coriolanus@129931		Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
coriolanus@129984		Nothing but his report.
coriolanus@130009	
coriolanus@130010	Messenger	Yes, worthy sir,
coriolanus@130037		The slave's report is seconded; and more,
coriolanus@130080		More fearful, is deliver'd.
coriolanus@130109	
coriolanus@130110	SICINIUS	What more fearful?
coriolanus@130138	
coriolanus@130139	Messenger	It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
coriolanus@130189		How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
coriolanus@130232		Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
coriolanus@130283		And vows revenge as spacious as between
coriolanus@130324		The young'st and oldest thing.
coriolanus@130356	
coriolanus@130357	SICINIUS	This is most likely!
coriolanus@130387	
coriolanus@130388	BRUTUS	Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
coriolanus@130438		Good Marcius home again.
coriolanus@130464	
coriolanus@130465	SICINIUS	The very trick on't.
coriolanus@130495	
coriolanus@130496	MENENIUS	This is unlikely:
coriolanus@130523		He and Aufidius can no more atone
coriolanus@130558		Than violentest contrariety.

coriolanus@130667		A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
coriolanus@130705		Associated with Aufidius, rages
coriolanus@130738		Upon our territories; and have already
coriolanus@130778		O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
coriolanus@130829		What lay before them.
coriolanus@130852	
coriolanus@130853		[Enter COMINIUS]
coriolanus@130871

coriolanus@130909	
coriolanus@130910	MENENIUS	What news? what news?
coriolanus@130941	
coriolanus@130942	COMINIUS	You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
coriolanus@130998		To melt the city leads upon your pates,
coriolanus@131039		To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
coriolanus@131087	
coriolanus@131088	MENENIUS	What's the news? what's the news?
coriolanus@131131	
coriolanus@131132	COMINIUS	Your temples burned in their cement, and
coriolanus@131182		Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
coriolanus@131228		Into an auger's bore.
coriolanus@131251	
coriolanus@131252	MENENIUS	Pray now, your news?
coriolanus@131282		You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
coriolanus@131339		If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--
coriolanus@131386	
coriolanus@131387	COMINIUS	If!
coriolanus@131400		He is their god: he leads them like a thing
coriolanus@131445		Made by some other deity than nature,
coriolanus@131484		That shapes man better; and they follow him,
coriolanus@131530		Against us brats, with no less confidence
coriolanus@131573		Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
coriolanus@131613		Or butchers killing flies.
coriolanus@131641	
coriolanus@131642	MENENIUS	You have made good work,
coriolanus@131676		You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
coriolanus@131727		on the voice of occupation and
coriolanus@131759		The breath of garlic-eaters!
coriolanus@131789	
coriolanus@131790	COMINIUS	He will shake
coriolanus@131813		Your Rome about your ears.
coriolanus@131841	
coriolanus@131842	MENENIUS	As Hercules
coriolanus@131863		Did shake down mellow fruit.
coriolanus@131893		You have made fair work!
coriolanus@131919	
coriolanus@131920	BRUTUS	But is this true, sir?
coriolanus@131950	
coriolanus@131951	COMINIUS	Ay; and you'll look pale
coriolanus@131985		Before you find it other. All the regions
coriolanus@132028		Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
coriolanus@132065		Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
coriolanus@132100		And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
coriolanus@132152		Your enemies and his find something in him.
coriolanus@132197	
coriolanus@132198	MENENIUS	We are all undone, unless
coriolanus@132233		The noble man have mercy.
coriolanus@132260	
coriolanus@132261	COMINIUS	Who shall ask it?
coriolanus@132288		The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
coriolanus@132336		Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
coriolanus@132374		Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
coriolanus@132428		Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
coriolanus@132481		As those should do that had deserved his hate,
coriolanus@132529		And therein show'd like enemies.
coriolanus@132563	
coriolanus@132564	MENENIUS	'Tis true:
coriolanus@132584		If he were putting to my house the brand
coriolanus@132626		That should consume it, I have not the face
coriolanus@132671		To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
coriolanus@132727		You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
coriolanus@132772	
coriolanus@132773	COMINIUS	You have brought
coriolanus@132799		A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
coriolanus@132841		So incapable of help.
coriolanus@132864	
coriolanus@132865	Both Tribunes	Say not we brought it.
coriolanus@132902	
coriolanus@132903	MENENIUS	How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
coriolanus@132958		And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
coriolanus@133009		Who did hoot him out o' the city.
coriolanus@133044	
coriolanus@133045	COMINIUS	But I fear
coriolanus@133065		They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
coriolanus@133110		The second name of men, obeys his points
coriolanus@133152		As if he were his officer: desperation
coriolanus@133192		Is all the policy, strength and defence,
coriolanus@133234		That Rome can make against them.
coriolanus@133268	
coriolanus@133269		[Enter a troop of Citizens]
coriolanus@133298	
coriolanus@133299	MENENIUS	Here come the clusters.
coriolanus@133332		And is Aufidius with him? You are they
coriolanus@133372		That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
coriolanus@133418		Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
coriolanus@133459		Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
coriolanus@133496		And not a hair upon a soldier's head
coriolanus@133534		Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
coriolanus@133581		As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
coriolanus@133624		And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
coriolanus@133670		if he could burn us all into one coal,
coriolanus@133710		We have deserved it.
coriolanus@133732	
coriolanus@133733	Citizens	Faith, we hear fearful news.
coriolanus@133771	
coriolanus@133772	First Citizen	For mine own part,
coriolanus@133805		When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
coriolanus@133850	
coriolanus@133851	Second Citizen	And so did I.
coriolanus@133880	
coriolanus@133881	Third Citizen	And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
coriolanus@133944		many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
coriolanus@133995		though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
coriolanus@134049		it was against our will.
coriolanus@134075	
coriolanus@134076	COMINIUS	Ye re goodly things, you voices!
coriolanus@134118	
coriolanus@134119	MENENIUS	You have made
coriolanus@134142		Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
coriolanus@134196

coriolanus@134311		These are a side that would be glad to have
coriolanus@134356		This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
coriolanus@134404		And show no sign of fear.
coriolanus@134431	
coriolanus@134432	First Citizen	The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
coriolanus@134497		I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
coriolanus@134548		him.
coriolanus@134554	
coriolanus@134555	Second Citizen	So did we all. But, come, let's home.

coriolanus@134910	
coriolanus@134911	AUFIDIUS	Do they still fly to the Roman?
coriolanus@134952	
coriolanus@134953	Lieutenant	I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
coriolanus@135008		Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
coriolanus@135056		Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
coriolanus@135103		And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
coriolanus@135146		Even by your own.
coriolanus@135165	
coriolanus@135166	AUFIDIUS	                  I cannot help it now,
coriolanus@135215		Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
coriolanus@135256		Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
coriolanus@135305		Even to my person, than I thought he would
coriolanus@135349		When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
coriolanus@135395		In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
coriolanus@135439		What cannot be amended.
coriolanus@135464	
coriolanus@135465	Lieutenant	Yet I wish, sir,--
coriolanus@135495		I mean for your particular,--you had not
coriolanus@135537		Join'd in commission with him; but either
coriolanus@135580		Had borne the action of yourself, or else
coriolanus@135623		To him had left it solely.
coriolanus@135651	
coriolanus@135652	AUFIDIUS	I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
coriolanus@135703		when he shall come to his account, he knows not
coriolanus@135752		What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
coriolanus@135801		And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
coriolanus@135844		To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
coriolanus@135897		And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
coriolanus@135947		Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
coriolanus@135993		As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
coriolanus@136037		That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
coriolanus@136086		Whene'er we come to our account.
coriolanus@136120	
coriolanus@136121	Lieutenant	Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
coriolanus@136180	
coriolanus@136181	AUFIDIUS	All places yield to him ere he sits down;
coriolanus@136232		And the nobility of Rome are his:
coriolanus@136267		The senators and patricians love him too:
coriolanus@136310		The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
coriolanus@136358		Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
coriolanus@136399		To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
coriolanus@136446		As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
coriolanus@136490		By sovereignty of nature. First he was
coriolanus@136530		A noble servant to them; but he could not
coriolanus@136573		Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
coriolanus@136619		Which out of daily fortune ever taints
coriolanus@136659		The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
coriolanus@136703		To fail in the disposing of those chances
coriolanus@136746		Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
coriolanus@136788		Not to be other than one thing, not moving
coriolanus@136832		From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
coriolanus@136886		Even with the same austerity and garb
coriolanus@136925		As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
coriolanus@136971		As he hath spices of them all, not all,
coriolanus@137012		For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
coriolanus@137058		So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
coriolanus@137106		To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
coriolanus@137152		Lie in the interpretation of the time:
coriolanus@137192		And power, unto itself most commendable,
coriolanus@137234		Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
coriolanus@137273		To extol what it hath done.
coriolanus@137302		One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
coriolanus@137353		Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
coriolanus@137411		Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,

coriolanus@137641	
coriolanus@137642	MENENIUS	No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
coriolanus@137695		Which was sometime his general; who loved him
coriolanus@137742		In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
coriolanus@137791		But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
coriolanus@137837		A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
coriolanus@137881		The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
coriolanus@137923		To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
coriolanus@137967	
coriolanus@137968	COMINIUS	He would not seem to know me.
coriolanus@138007	
coriolanus@138008	MENENIUS	Do you hear?
coriolanus@138030	
coriolanus@138031	COMINIUS	Yet one time he did call me by my name:
coriolanus@138080		I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
coriolanus@138125		That we have bled together. Coriolanus
coriolanus@138165		He would not answer to: forbad all names;
coriolanus@138208		He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
coriolanus@138246		Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
coriolanus@138293		Of burning Rome.
coriolanus@138311	
coriolanus@138312	MENENIUS	Why, so: you have made good work!
coriolanus@138355		A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
coriolanus@138402		To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
coriolanus@138441	
coriolanus@138442	COMINIUS	I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
coriolanus@138490		When it was less expected: he replied,
coriolanus@138530		It was a bare petition of a state
coriolanus@138565		To one whom they had punish'd.
coriolanus@138597	
coriolanus@138598	MENENIUS	Very well:
coriolanus@138618		Could he say less?
coriolanus@138638	
coriolanus@138639	COMINIUS	I offer'd to awaken his regard
coriolanus@138679		For's private friends: his answer to me was,
coriolanus@138725		He could not stay to pick them in a pile
coriolanus@138767		Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
coriolanus@138813		For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
coriolanus@138859		And still to nose the offence.
coriolanus@138891	
coriolanus@138892	MENENIUS	For one poor grain or two!
coriolanus@138928		I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
coriolanus@138977		And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
coriolanus@139024		You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
coriolanus@139068		Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
coriolanus@139111	
coriolanus@139112	SICINIUS	Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
coriolanus@139167		In this so never-needed help, yet do not
coriolanus@139209		Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
coriolanus@139257		Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
coriolanus@139309		More than the instant army we can make,
coriolanus@139350		Might stop our countryman.
coriolanus@139378	
coriolanus@139379	MENENIUS	No, I'll not meddle.
coriolanus@139409	
coriolanus@139410	SICINIUS	Pray you, go to him.
coriolanus@139440	
coriolanus@139441	MENENIUS	What should I do?
coriolanus@139468	
coriolanus@139469	BRUTUS	Only make trial what your love can do
coriolanus@139514		For Rome, towards Marcius.
coriolanus@139542	
coriolanus@139543	MENENIUS	Well, and say that Marcius
coriolanus@139579		Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
coriolanus@139616		Unheard; what then?
coriolanus@139637		But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
coriolanus@139679		With his unkindness? say't be so?
coriolanus@139714	
coriolanus@139715	SICINIUS	Yet your good will
coriolanus@139743		must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
coriolanus@139795		As you intended well.
coriolanus@139818	
coriolanus@139819	MENENIUS	I'll undertake 't:
coriolanus@139847		I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
coriolanus@139892		And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
coriolanus@139937		He was not taken well; he had not dined:
coriolanus@139979		The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
coriolanus@140028		We pout upon the morning, are unapt
coriolanus@140065		To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
coriolanus@140114		These and these conveyances of our blood
coriolanus@140156		With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
coriolanus@140202		Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
coriolanus@140259		Till he be dieted to my request,
coriolanus@140293		And then I'll set upon him.
coriolanus@140322	
coriolanus@140323	BRUTUS	You know the very road into his kindness,
coriolanus@140372		And cannot lose your way.
coriolanus@140399	
coriolanus@140400	MENENIUS	Good faith, I'll prove him,

coriolanus@140672		The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
coriolanus@140719		'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
coriolanus@140768		Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
coriolanus@140819		He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
coriolanus@140868		Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
coriolanus@140916		So that all hope is vain.
coriolanus@140943		Unless his noble mother, and his wife;

coriolanus@141600	
coriolanus@141601	Second Senator	You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
coriolanus@141663		You'll speak with Coriolanus.
coriolanus@141694	
coriolanus@141695	MENENIUS	Good my friends,
coriolanus@141721		If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
coriolanus@141767		And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
coriolanus@141816		My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
coriolanus@141864	
coriolanus@141865	First Senator	Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
coriolanus@141922		Is not here passable.
coriolanus@141945	
coriolanus@141946	MENENIUS	I tell thee, fellow,
coriolanus@141976		The general is my lover: I have been
coriolanus@142014		The book of his good acts, whence men have read
coriolanus@142063		His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
coriolanus@142104		For I have ever verified my friends,
coriolanus@142142		Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
coriolanus@142193		Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
coriolanus@142240		Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
coriolanus@142278		I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
coriolanus@142328		Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
coriolanus@142381		I must have leave to pass.
coriolanus@142409	
coriolanus@142410	First Senator	Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
coriolanus@142472		behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
coriolanus@142523		should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
coriolanus@142577		to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
coriolanus@142626	
coriolanus@142627	MENENIUS	Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
coriolanus@142683		always factionary on the party of your general.
coriolanus@142732	
coriolanus@142733	Second Senator	Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
coriolanus@142797		have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
coriolanus@142848		say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
coriolanus@142891	
coriolanus@142892	MENENIUS	Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
coriolanus@142948		speak with him till after dinner.

coriolanus@142984	First Senator	You are a Roman, are you?

coriolanus@143059	
coriolanus@143060	First Senator	Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
coriolanus@143122		when you have pushed out your gates the very
coriolanus@143168		defender of them, and, in a violent popular
coriolanus@143213		ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
coriolanus@143264		front his revenges with the easy groans of old
coriolanus@143312		women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
coriolanus@143366		the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
coriolanus@143420		you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
coriolanus@143467		intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
coriolanus@143519		such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
coriolanus@143568		therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
coriolanus@143615		execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
coriolanus@143668		you out of reprieve and pardon.
coriolanus@143701

coriolanus@143932		I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
coriolanus@143984		the utmost of your having: back.
coriolanus@144018

coriolanus@144179		You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
coriolanus@144234		perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
coriolanus@144287		my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
coriolanus@144338		with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
coriolanus@144386		hanging, or of some death more long in
coriolanus@144426		spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
coriolanus@144480		presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
coriolanus@144532	
coriolanus@144533		[To CORIOLANUS]
coriolanus@144550	
coriolanus@144551		The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy

coriolanus@144652		thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
coriolanus@144701		thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
coriolanus@144752		water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
coriolanus@144803		thee; but being assured none but myself could move
coriolanus@144855		thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
coriolanus@144903		sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
coriolanus@144952		petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
coriolanus@145003		wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
coriolanus@145053		here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
coriolanus@145101		access to thee.

coriolanus@145157

coriolanus@145213		Are servanted to others: though I owe
coriolanus@145252		My revenge properly, my remission lies
coriolanus@145292		In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
coriolanus@145342		Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather

coriolanus@145432		Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
coriolanus@145480		Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
coriolanus@145533		Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
coriolanus@145574	
coriolanus@145575		[Gives a letter]
coriolanus@145593	
coriolanus@145594		And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
coriolanus@145643		I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
coriolanus@145692		Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
coriolanus@145737	
coriolanus@145738	AUFIDIUS	You keep a constant temper.

coriolanus@145811	First Senator	Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
coriolanus@145858	
coriolanus@145859	Second Senator	'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
coriolanus@145925		way home again.
coriolanus@145942	
coriolanus@145943	First Senator	Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
coriolanus@146003		greatness back?
coriolanus@146020	
coriolanus@146021	Second Senator	What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
coriolanus@146079	
coriolanus@146080	MENENIUS	I neither care for the world nor your general: for
coriolanus@146140		such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
coriolanus@146193		ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
coriolanus@146241		himself fears it not from another: let your general
coriolanus@146294		do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
coriolanus@146345		your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
coriolanus@146396		as I was said to, Away!

coriolanus@146743		Set down our host. My partner in this action,
coriolanus@146790		You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
coriolanus@146842		I have borne this business.
coriolanus@146871	
coriolanus@146872	AUFIDIUS	Only their ends
coriolanus@146897		You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
coriolanus@146944		The general suit of Rome; never admitted
coriolanus@146986		A private whisper, no, not with such friends
coriolanus@147032		That thought them sure of you.
coriolanus@147064	
coriolanus@147065	CORIOLANUS	This last old man,
coriolanus@147095		Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
coriolanus@147143		Loved me above the measure of a father;
coriolanus@147184		Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
coriolanus@147229		Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
coriolanus@147274		Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
coriolanus@147324		The first conditions, which they did refuse
coriolanus@147369		And cannot now accept; to grace him only
coriolanus@147411		That thought he could do more, a very little
coriolanus@147457		I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
coriolanus@147504		Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
coriolanus@147555		Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?

coriolanus@147846		Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
coriolanus@147894		The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
coriolanus@147945		All bond and privilege of nature, break!
coriolanus@147987		Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
coriolanus@148024		What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
coriolanus@148075		Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
coriolanus@148125		Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
coriolanus@148173		As if Olympus to a molehill should
coriolanus@148209		In supplication nod: and my young boy
coriolanus@148248		Hath an aspect of intercession, which
coriolanus@148287		Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
coriolanus@148335		Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
coriolanus@148377		Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
coriolanus@148425		As if a man were author of himself
coriolanus@148461		And knew no other kin.

coriolanus@148644	
coriolanus@148645	CORIOLANUS	Like a dull actor now,
coriolanus@148679		I have forgot my part, and I am out,
coriolanus@148717		Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
coriolanus@148761		Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
coriolanus@148797		For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
coriolanus@148839		Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
coriolanus@148879		Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
coriolanus@148927		I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
coriolanus@148971		Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
coriolanus@149020		And the most noble mother of the world
coriolanus@149060		Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
coriolanus@149107	
coriolanus@149108		[Kneels]
coriolanus@149118	
coriolanus@149119		Of thy deep duty more impression show

coriolanus@149186	VOLUMNIA	O, stand up blest!
coriolanus@149214		Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
coriolanus@149262		I kneel before thee; and unproperly
coriolanus@149299		Show duty, as mistaken all this while

coriolanus@149490		Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
coriolanus@149537		Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
coriolanus@149585		Murdering impossibility, to make

coriolanus@149898	
coriolanus@149899	VOLUMNIA	This is a poor epitome of yours,
coriolanus@149941		Which by the interpretation of full time
coriolanus@149983		May show like all yourself.
coriolanus@150012	
coriolanus@150013	CORIOLANUS	The god of soldiers,
coriolanus@150045		With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
coriolanus@150087		Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
coriolanus@150139		To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
coriolanus@150185		Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
coriolanus@150230		And saving those that eye thee!

coriolanus@150433		Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
coriolanus@150475		The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
coriolanus@150521		Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
coriolanus@150560		Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
coriolanus@150596		Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
coriolanus@150638		Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
coriolanus@150676		To ally my rages and revenges with
coriolanus@150712		Your colder reasons.
coriolanus@150734	
coriolanus@150735	VOLUMNIA	O, no more, no more!
coriolanus@150765		You have said you will not grant us any thing;
coriolanus@150813		For we have nothing else to ask, but that
coriolanus@150856		Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
coriolanus@150898		That, if you fail in our request, the blame
coriolanus@150943		May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
coriolanus@150992	
coriolanus@150993	CORIOLANUS	Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
coriolanus@151047		Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
coriolanus@151096	
coriolanus@151097	VOLUMNIA	Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
coriolanus@151153		And state of bodies would bewray what life
coriolanus@151197		We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
coriolanus@151246		How more unfortunate than all living women
coriolanus@151290		Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
coriolanus@151333		which should
coriolanus@151347		Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
coriolanus@151390		with comforts,
coriolanus@151406		Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
coriolanus@151460		Making the mother, wife and child to see
coriolanus@151502		The son, the husband and the father tearing
coriolanus@151547		His country's bowels out. And to poor we
coriolanus@151589		Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
coriolanus@151635		Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
coriolanus@151680		That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
coriolanus@151720		Alas, how can we for our country pray.
coriolanus@151760		Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
coriolanus@151810		Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
coriolanus@151856		The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
coriolanus@151906		Our comfort in the country. We must find
coriolanus@151948		An evident calamity, though we had
coriolanus@151984		Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
coriolanus@152034		Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
coriolanus@152071		With manacles thorough our streets, or else
coriolanus@152116		triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
coriolanus@152159		And bear the palm for having bravely shed
coriolanus@152202		Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
coriolanus@152251		I purpose not to wait on fortune till
coriolanus@152290		These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
coriolanus@152339		Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
coriolanus@152383		Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
coriolanus@152431		March to assault thy country than to tread--
coriolanus@152477		Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
coriolanus@152528		That brought thee to this world.
coriolanus@152562	
coriolanus@152563	VIRGILIA	Ay, and mine,
coriolanus@152586		That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
coriolanus@152638		Living to time.
coriolanus@152655	
coriolanus@152656	Young MARCIUS	A' shall not tread on me;

coriolanus@152865		[Rising]
coriolanus@152875	
coriolanus@152876	VOLUMNIA	Nay, go not from us thus.
coriolanus@152911		If it were so that our request did tend
coriolanus@152952		To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
coriolanus@152992		The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
coriolanus@153043		As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
coriolanus@153086		Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
coriolanus@153133		May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
coriolanus@153183		'This we received;' and each in either side
coriolanus@153228		Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
coriolanus@153273		For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
coriolanus@153326		The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
coriolanus@153373		That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
coriolanus@153414		Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
coriolanus@153461		Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
coriolanus@153507		Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
coriolanus@153555		But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
coriolanus@153599		Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
coriolanus@153644		To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
coriolanus@153693		Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
coriolanus@153741		To imitate the graces of the gods;
coriolanus@153777		To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
coriolanus@153827		And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
coriolanus@153870		That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
coriolanus@153920		Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
coriolanus@153965		Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
coriolanus@154013		He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
coriolanus@154062		Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
coriolanus@154107		Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
coriolanus@154158		More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
coriolanus@154210		Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
coriolanus@154263		Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
coriolanus@154301		When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
coriolanus@154347		Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
coriolanus@154394		Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
coriolanus@154440		And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
coriolanus@154481		Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
coriolanus@154534		That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
coriolanus@154580		To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
coriolanus@154624		Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
coriolanus@154672		To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
coriolanus@154717		Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
coriolanus@154758		This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
coriolanus@154802		And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
coriolanus@154849		This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
coriolanus@154896		But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
coriolanus@154943		Does reason our petition with more strength
coriolanus@154988		Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
coriolanus@155033		This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
coriolanus@155076		His wife is in Corioli and his child
coriolanus@155114		Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
coriolanus@155161		I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
coriolanus@155200		And then I'll speak a little.
coriolanus@155231	
coriolanus@155232		[He holds her by the hand, silent]
coriolanus@155268	
coriolanus@155269	CORIOLANUS	O mother, mother!
coriolanus@155298		What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
coriolanus@155347		The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
coriolanus@155393		They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
coriolanus@155433		You have won a happy victory to Rome;
coriolanus@155472		But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
coriolanus@155520		Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
coriolanus@155567		If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
coriolanus@155613		Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
coriolanus@155656		I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
coriolanus@155706		Were you in my stead, would you have heard
coriolanus@155750		A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?
coriolanus@155793	
coriolanus@155794	AUFIDIUS	I was moved withal.
coriolanus@155823	
coriolanus@155824	CORIOLANUS	I dare be sworn you were:
coriolanus@155861		And, sir, it is no little thing to make
coriolanus@155902		Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
coriolanus@155949		What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
coriolanus@155998		I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
coriolanus@156051		Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
coriolanus@156095	
coriolanus@156096	AUFIDIUS	[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
coriolanus@156152		thy honour
coriolanus@156164		At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
coriolanus@156210		Myself a former fortune.

coriolanus@156474		Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve

coriolanus@157340	SICINIUS	He loved his mother dearly.
coriolanus@157377	
coriolanus@157378	MENENIUS	So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
coriolanus@157437		now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
coriolanus@157485		of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
coriolanus@157535		moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
coriolanus@157588		his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
coriolanus@157639		his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
coriolanus@157686		battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
coriolanus@157738		Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
coriolanus@157788		his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
coriolanus@157841		and a heaven to throne in.
coriolanus@157869	
coriolanus@157870	SICINIUS	Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
coriolanus@157916	
coriolanus@157917	MENENIUS	I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
coriolanus@157976		mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
coriolanus@158029		in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
coriolanus@158078		shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
coriolanus@158129		you.
coriolanus@158135	
coriolanus@158136	SICINIUS	The gods be good unto us!
coriolanus@158171	
coriolanus@158172	MENENIUS	No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
coriolanus@158231		us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
coriolanus@158281		and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.

coriolanus@158342		[Enter a Messenger]
coriolanus@158363	
coriolanus@158364	Messenger	Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
coriolanus@158424		The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
coriolanus@158468		And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
coriolanus@158512		The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
coriolanus@158554		They'll give him death by inches.
coriolanus@158589	
coriolanus@158590		[Enter a second Messenger]
coriolanus@158618	
coriolanus@158619	SICINIUS	What's the news?
coriolanus@158645	
coriolanus@158646	Second Messenger	Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
coriolanus@158712		The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
coriolanus@158760		A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
coriolanus@158801		No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
coriolanus@158841	
coriolanus@158842	SICINIUS	Friend,
coriolanus@158859		Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
coriolanus@158911	
coriolanus@158912	Second Messenger	As certain as I know the sun is fire:
coriolanus@158967		Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
coriolanus@159018		Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
coriolanus@159068		As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!

coriolanus@159296	
coriolanus@159297		[A shout within]
coriolanus@159315	
coriolanus@159316	MENENIUS	This is good news:
coriolanus@159344		I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
coriolanus@159386		Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
coriolanus@159430		A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
coriolanus@159470		A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
coriolanus@159521		This morning for ten thousand of your throats
coriolanus@159568		I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
coriolanus@159616	
coriolanus@159617		[Music still, with shouts]
coriolanus@159645	
coriolanus@159646	SICINIUS	First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
coriolanus@159705		Accept my thankfulness.
coriolanus@159730	
coriolanus@159731	Second Messenger	Sir, we have all
coriolanus@159765		Great cause to give great thanks.
coriolanus@159800	
coriolanus@159801	SICINIUS	They are near the city?
coriolanus@159834	
coriolanus@159835	Second Messenger	Almost at point to enter.
coriolanus@159878

coriolanus@161018	
coriolanus@161019		Most welcome!
coriolanus@161034	
coriolanus@161035	First Conspirator	How is it with our general?
coriolanus@161081	
coriolanus@161082	AUFIDIUS	Even so
coriolanus@161099		As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
coriolanus@161142		And with his charity slain.
coriolanus@161171	
coriolanus@161172	Second Conspirator	Most noble sir,
coriolanus@161207		If you do hold the same intent wherein
coriolanus@161247		You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
coriolanus@161289		Of your great danger.
coriolanus@161312	
coriolanus@161313	AUFIDIUS	Sir, I cannot tell:
coriolanus@161342		We must proceed as we do find the people.
coriolanus@161385	
coriolanus@161386	Third Conspirator	The people will remain uncertain whilst
coriolanus@161444		'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
coriolanus@161499		Makes the survivor heir of all.
coriolanus@161532	
coriolanus@161533	AUFIDIUS	I know it;
coriolanus@161553		And my pretext to strike at him admits
coriolanus@161593		A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
coriolanus@161642		Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
coriolanus@161695		He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
coriolanus@161745		Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
coriolanus@161788		He bow'd his nature, never known before
coriolanus@161829		But to be rough, unswayable and free.
coriolanus@161868	
coriolanus@161869	Third Conspirator	Sir, his stoutness
coriolanus@161906		When he did stand for consul, which he lost
coriolanus@161951		By lack of stooping,--
coriolanus@161975	
coriolanus@161976	AUFIDIUS	That I would have spoke of:
coriolanus@162013		Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
coriolanus@162060		Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
coriolanus@162107		Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
coriolanus@162153		In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
coriolanus@162198		Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
coriolanus@162244		My best and freshest men; served his designments
coriolanus@162294		In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
coriolanus@162337		Which he did end all his; and took some pride
coriolanus@162384		To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
coriolanus@162429		I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
coriolanus@162470		He waged me with his countenance, as if
coriolanus@162511		I had been mercenary.
coriolanus@162534	
coriolanus@162535	First Conspirator	So he did, my lord:
coriolanus@162573		The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
coriolanus@162618		When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
coriolanus@162663		For no less spoil than glory,--
coriolanus@162696	
coriolanus@162697	AUFIDIUS	There was it:
coriolanus@162720		For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
coriolanus@162770		At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
coriolanus@162814		As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
coriolanus@162862		Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
coriolanus@162908		And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
coriolanus@162951	
coriolanus@162952		[Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of
coriolanus@163001		the People]
coriolanus@163014	
coriolanus@163015	First Conspirator	Your native town you enter'd like a post,
coriolanus@163075		And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
coriolanus@163118		Splitting the air with noise.
coriolanus@163149	
coriolanus@163150	Second Conspirator	And patient fools,
coriolanus@163188		Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
coriolanus@163243		With giving him glory.
coriolanus@163267	
coriolanus@163268	Third Conspirator	Therefore, at your vantage,
coriolanus@163314		Ere he express himself, or move the people
coriolanus@163358		With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
coriolanus@163408		Which we will second. When he lies along,
coriolanus@163451		After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
coriolanus@163498		His reasons with his body.
coriolanus@163526	
coriolanus@163527	AUFIDIUS	Say no more:
coriolanus@163549		Here come the lords.
coriolanus@163571	
coriolanus@163572		[Enter the Lords of the city]
coriolanus@163603	
coriolanus@163604	All The Lords	You are most welcome home.
coriolanus@163645	
coriolanus@163646	AUFIDIUS	I have not deserved it.
coriolanus@163679		But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
coriolanus@163726		What I have written to you?
coriolanus@163755	
coriolanus@163756	Lords	We have.
coriolanus@163771	
coriolanus@163772	First Lord	And grieve to hear't.
coriolanus@163805		What faults he made before the last, I think
coriolanus@163851		Might have found easy fines: but there to end
coriolanus@163898		Where he was to begin and give away
coriolanus@163935		The benefit of our levies, answering us
coriolanus@163976		With our own charge, making a treaty where
coriolanus@164020		There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
coriolanus@164067	
coriolanus@164068	AUFIDIUS	He approaches: you shall hear him.
coriolanus@164112	
coriolanus@164113		[Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and
coriolanus@164156		colours; commoners being with him]
coriolanus@164192	
coriolanus@164193	CORIOLANUS	Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
coriolanus@164245		No more infected with my country's love
coriolanus@164286		Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
coriolanus@164334		Under your great command. You are to know
coriolanus@164377		That prosperously I have attempted and
coriolanus@164417		With bloody passage led your wars even to
coriolanus@164460		The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
coriolanus@164512		Do more than counterpoise a full third part
coriolanus@164557		The charges of the action. We have made peace
coriolanus@164604		With no less honour to the Antiates
coriolanus@164641		Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
coriolanus@164689		Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
coriolanus@164732		Together with the seal o' the senate, what
coriolanus@164776		We have compounded on.
coriolanus@164800	
coriolanus@164801	AUFIDIUS	Read it not, noble lords;
coriolanus@164836		But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
coriolanus@164881		He hath abused your powers.
coriolanus@164910	
coriolanus@164911	CORIOLANUS	Traitor! how now!
coriolanus@164940	
coriolanus@164941	AUFIDIUS	                  Ay, traitor, Marcius!
coriolanus@164990	
coriolanus@164991	CORIOLANUS	Marcius!
coriolanus@165011	
coriolanus@165012	AUFIDIUS	Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
coriolanus@165065		I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
coriolanus@165117		Coriolanus in Corioli?
coriolanus@165141		You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
coriolanus@165189		He has betray'd your business, and given up,
coriolanus@165235		For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
coriolanus@165279		I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
coriolanus@165323		Breaking his oath and resolution like
coriolanus@165362		A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
coriolanus@165403		Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
coriolanus@165449		He whined and roar'd away your victory,
coriolanus@165490		That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
coriolanus@165534		Look'd wondering each at other.
coriolanus@165567	
coriolanus@165568	CORIOLANUS	Hear'st thou, Mars?
coriolanus@165599	
coriolanus@165600	AUFIDIUS	Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
coriolanus@165646	
coriolanus@165647	CORIOLANUS	Ha!
coriolanus@165662	
coriolanus@165663	AUFIDIUS	No more.
coriolanus@165681	
coriolanus@165682	CORIOLANUS	Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
coriolanus@165735		Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
coriolanus@165782		Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
coriolanus@165831		I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
coriolanus@165887		Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
coriolanus@165937		Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
coriolanus@165984		Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
coriolanus@166031		To thrust the lie unto him.
coriolanus@166060	
coriolanus@166061	First Lord	Peace, both, and hear me speak.
coriolanus@166104	
coriolanus@166105	CORIOLANUS	Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
coriolanus@166157		Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
coriolanus@166204		If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
coriolanus@166252		That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
coriolanus@166291		Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
coriolanus@166329		Alone I did it. Boy!
coriolanus@166351	
coriolanus@166352	AUFIDIUS	Why, noble lords,
coriolanus@166379		Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
coriolanus@166426		Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
coriolanus@166474		'Fore your own eyes and ears?
coriolanus@166505	
coriolanus@166506	All Conspirators	Let him die for't.
coriolanus@166542	
coriolanus@166543	All The People	'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
coriolanus@166610		my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
coriolanus@166656		Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
coriolanus@166689	
coriolanus@166690	Second Lord	Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
coriolanus@166732		The man is noble and his fame folds-in
coriolanus@166772		This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
coriolanus@166820		Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
coriolanus@166868		And trouble not the peace.
coriolanus@166896	
coriolanus@166897	CORIOLANUS	O that I had him,
coriolanus@166926		With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
coriolanus@166968		To use my lawful sword!
coriolanus@166993	
coriolanus@166994	AUFIDIUS	Insolent villain!

coriolanus@167224	
coriolanus@167225	First Lord	O Tullus,--
coriolanus@167248	
coriolanus@167249	Second Lord	Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
coriolanus@167309	
coriolanus@167310	Third Lord	Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
coriolanus@167364		Put up your swords.
coriolanus@167385	
coriolanus@167386	AUFIDIUS	My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
coriolanus@167443		Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
coriolanus@167490		Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
coriolanus@167541		That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
coriolanus@167590		To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
coriolanus@167631		Myself your loyal servant, or endure
coriolanus@167669		Your heaviest censure.
coriolanus@167693	
coriolanus@167694	First Lord	Bear from hence his body;
coriolanus@167731		And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
coriolanus@167775		As the most noble corse that ever herald
coriolanus@167817		Did follow to his urn.
coriolanus@167841	
coriolanus@167842	Second Lord	His own impatience
coriolanus@167873		Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
coriolanus@167917		Let's make the best of it.
coriolanus@167945	
coriolanus@167946	AUFIDIUS	My rage is gone;
coriolanus@167972		And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
coriolanus@168015		Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
coriolanus@168067		Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
coriolanus@168114		Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
coriolanus@168162		Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
coriolanus@168202		Which to this hour bewail the injury,
coriolanus@168241		Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.

cymbeline@1434	
cymbeline@1435	
cymbeline@1436		[Enter two Gentlemen]
cymbeline@1459	
cymbeline@1460	First Gentleman	You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
cymbeline@1521		No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
cymbeline@1566		Still seem as does the king.
cymbeline@1596	
cymbeline@1597	Second Gentleman	But what's the matter?
cymbeline@1637	
cymbeline@1638	First Gentleman	His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
cymbeline@1700		He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
cymbeline@1745		That late he married--hath referr'd herself
cymbeline@1790		Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
cymbeline@1839		Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
cymbeline@1882		Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
cymbeline@1926		Be touch'd at very heart.
cymbeline@1953	
cymbeline@1954	Second Gentleman	None but the king?
cymbeline@1990	
cymbeline@1991	First Gentleman	He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
cymbeline@2051		That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
cymbeline@2101		Although they wear their faces to the bent
cymbeline@2145		Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
cymbeline@2193		Glad at the thing they scowl at.
cymbeline@2227	
cymbeline@2228	Second Gentleman	And why so?
cymbeline@2257	
cymbeline@2258	First Gentleman	He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
cymbeline@2318		Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
cymbeline@2366		I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
cymbeline@2410		And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
cymbeline@2454		As, to seek through the regions of the earth
cymbeline@2500		For one his like, there would be something failing
cymbeline@2552		In him that should compare. I do not think
cymbeline@2596		So fair an outward and such stuff within
cymbeline@2638		Endows a man but he.
cymbeline@2660	
cymbeline@2661	Second Gentleman	You speak him far.
cymbeline@2697	
cymbeline@2698	First Gentleman	I do extend him, sir, within himself,
cymbeline@2752		Crush him together rather than unfold
cymbeline@2791		His measure duly.
cymbeline@2810	
cymbeline@2811	Second Gentleman	                  What's his name and birth?
cymbeline@2873	
cymbeline@2874	First Gentleman	I cannot delve him to the root: his father
cymbeline@2933		Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
cymbeline@2979		Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
cymbeline@3016		But had his titles by Tenantius whom
cymbeline@3054		He served with glory and admired success,
cymbeline@3097		So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
cymbeline@3135		And had, besides this gentleman in question,
cymbeline@3181		Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
cymbeline@3226		Died with their swords in hand; for which
cymbeline@3269		their father,
cymbeline@3284		Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
cymbeline@3330		That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
cymbeline@3372		Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
cymbeline@3415		As he was born. The king he takes the babe
cymbeline@3459		To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
cymbeline@3509		Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
cymbeline@3555		Puts to him all the learnings that his time
cymbeline@3600		Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
cymbeline@3648		As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
cymbeline@3689		And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
cymbeline@3741		Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
cymbeline@3792		A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
cymbeline@3838		A glass that feated them, and to the graver
cymbeline@3883		A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
cymbeline@3930		For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
cymbeline@3974		Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
cymbeline@4022		By her election may be truly read
cymbeline@4057		What kind of man he is.
cymbeline@4082	
cymbeline@4083	Second Gentleman	I honour him
cymbeline@4113		Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
cymbeline@4163		Is she sole child to the king?
cymbeline@4195	
cymbeline@4196	First Gentleman	His only child.
cymbeline@4228		He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
cymbeline@4277		Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
cymbeline@4326		I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
cymbeline@4381		Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
cymbeline@4434		Which way they went.
cymbeline@4456	
cymbeline@4457	Second Gentleman	How long is this ago?
cymbeline@4496	
cymbeline@4497	First Gentleman	Some twenty years.
cymbeline@4532	
cymbeline@4533	Second Gentleman	That a king's children should be so convey'd,
cymbeline@4596		So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
cymbeline@4641		That could not trace them!
cymbeline@4669	
cymbeline@4670	First Gentleman	Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
cymbeline@4710		Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
cymbeline@4758		Yet is it true, sir.
cymbeline@4780	
cymbeline@4781	Second Gentleman	I do well believe you.
cymbeline@4821	
cymbeline@4822	First Gentleman	We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,
cymbeline@4881		The queen, and princess.
cymbeline@4907	
cymbeline@4908		[Exeunt]
cymbeline@4918	
cymbeline@4919		[Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN]
cymbeline@4970	
cymbeline@4971	QUEEN	No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
cymbeline@5025		After the slander of most stepmothers,
cymbeline@5065		Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
cymbeline@5110		Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
cymbeline@5150		That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
cymbeline@5200		So soon as I can win the offended king,
cymbeline@5241		I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
cymbeline@5284		The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
cymbeline@5329		You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
cymbeline@5378		Your wisdom may inform you.
cymbeline@5407	
cymbeline@5408	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Please your highness,
cymbeline@5449		I will from hence to-day.
cymbeline@5476	
cymbeline@5477	QUEEN	You know the peril.
cymbeline@5503		I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
cymbeline@5548		The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
cymbeline@5597		Hath charged you should not speak together.
cymbeline@5642	
cymbeline@5643		[Exit]
cymbeline@5651	
cymbeline@5652	IMOGEN	O
cymbeline@5661		Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
cymbeline@5705		Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
cymbeline@5755		I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
cymbeline@5806		Always reserved my holy duty--what
cymbeline@5842		His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
cymbeline@5884		And I shall here abide the hourly shot
cymbeline@5924		Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
cymbeline@5963		But that there is this jewel in the world
cymbeline@6006		That I may see again.
cymbeline@6029	
cymbeline@6030	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	My queen! my mistress!
cymbeline@6072		O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
cymbeline@6113		To be suspected of more tenderness
cymbeline@6149		Than doth become a man. I will remain
cymbeline@6188		The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
cymbeline@6238		My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
cymbeline@6279		Who to my father was a friend, to me
cymbeline@6317		Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
cymbeline@6364		And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
cymbeline@6415		Though ink be made of gall.
cymbeline@6444	
cymbeline@6445		[Re-enter QUEEN]
cymbeline@6463	
cymbeline@6464	QUEEN	Be brief, I pray you:
cymbeline@6492		If the king come, I shall incur I know not
cymbeline@6536		How much of his displeasure.
cymbeline@6566	
cymbeline@6567		[Aside]
cymbeline@6576	
cymbeline@6577			        Yet I'll move him
cymbeline@6605		To walk this way: I never do him wrong,
cymbeline@6646		But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
cymbeline@6691		Pays dear for my offences.
cymbeline@6719	
cymbeline@6720		[Exit]
cymbeline@6728	
cymbeline@6729	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Should we be taking leave
cymbeline@6774		As long a term as yet we have to live,
cymbeline@6814		The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
cymbeline@6858	
cymbeline@6859	IMOGEN	Nay, stay a little:
cymbeline@6886		Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
cymbeline@6930		Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
cymbeline@6977		This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
cymbeline@7024		But keep it till you woo another wife,
cymbeline@7064		When Imogen is dead.
cymbeline@7086	
cymbeline@7087	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	How, how! another?
cymbeline@7125		You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
cymbeline@7168		And sear up my embracements from a next
cymbeline@7209		With bonds of death!
cymbeline@7231	
cymbeline@7232		[Putting on the ring]
cymbeline@7255	
cymbeline@7256			Remain, remain thou here
cymbeline@7283		While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
cymbeline@7336		As I my poor self did exchange for you,
cymbeline@7377		To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
cymbeline@7422		I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
cymbeline@7466		It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
cymbeline@7506		Upon this fairest prisoner.
cymbeline@7535	
cymbeline@7536		[Putting a bracelet upon her arm]
cymbeline@7571	
cymbeline@7572	IMOGEN	O the gods!
cymbeline@7591		When shall we see again?
cymbeline@7617	
cymbeline@7618		[Enter CYMBELINE and Lords]
cymbeline@7647	
cymbeline@7648	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Alack, the king!
cymbeline@7684	
cymbeline@7685	CYMBELINE	Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!
cymbeline@7743		If after this command thou fraught the court
cymbeline@7789		With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
cymbeline@7831		Thou'rt poison to my blood.
cymbeline@7860	
cymbeline@7861	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	The gods protect you!
cymbeline@7902		And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.
cymbeline@7958	
cymbeline@7959		[Exit]
cymbeline@7967	
cymbeline@7968	IMOGEN	                  There cannot be a pinch in death
cymbeline@8026		More sharp than this is.
cymbeline@8052	
cymbeline@8053	CYMBELINE	O disloyal thing,
cymbeline@8081		That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
cymbeline@8126		A year's age on me.
cymbeline@8147	
cymbeline@8148	IMOGEN	I beseech you, sir,
cymbeline@8175		Harm not yourself with your vexation
cymbeline@8213		I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
cymbeline@8262		Subdues all pangs, all fears.
cymbeline@8293	
cymbeline@8294	CYMBELINE	Past grace? obedience?
cymbeline@8327	
cymbeline@8328	IMOGEN	Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.
cymbeline@8384	
cymbeline@8385	CYMBELINE	That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
cymbeline@8443	
cymbeline@8444	IMOGEN	O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
cymbeline@8496		And did avoid a puttock.
cymbeline@8522	
cymbeline@8523	CYMBELINE	Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
cymbeline@8584		A seat for baseness.
cymbeline@8606	
cymbeline@8607	IMOGEN	No; I rather added
cymbeline@8633		A lustre to it.
cymbeline@8650	
cymbeline@8651	CYMBELINE	                  O thou vile one!
cymbeline@8696	
cymbeline@8697	IMOGEN	Sir,
cymbeline@8709		It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
cymbeline@8756		You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
cymbeline@8798		A man worth any woman, overbuys me
cymbeline@8834		Almost the sum he pays.
cymbeline@8859	
cymbeline@8860	CYMBELINE	What, art thou mad?
cymbeline@8890	
cymbeline@8891	IMOGEN	Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
cymbeline@8943		A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
cymbeline@8984		Our neighbour shepherd's son!
cymbeline@9015	
cymbeline@9016	CYMBELINE	Thou foolish thing!
cymbeline@9046	
cymbeline@9047		[Re-enter QUEEN]
cymbeline@9065	
cymbeline@9066		They were again together: you have done
cymbeline@9107		Not after our command. Away with her,
cymbeline@9146		And pen her up.
cymbeline@9163	
cymbeline@9164	QUEEN	                  Beseech your patience. Peace,
cymbeline@9218		Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
cymbeline@9263		Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
cymbeline@9318		Out of your best advice.
cymbeline@9344	
cymbeline@9345	CYMBELINE	Nay, let her languish
cymbeline@9377		A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
cymbeline@9418		Die of this folly!
cymbeline@9438	
cymbeline@9439		[Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords]
cymbeline@9469	
cymbeline@9470	QUEEN	                  Fie! you must give way.
cymbeline@9518	
cymbeline@9519		[Enter PISANIO]
cymbeline@9536	
cymbeline@9537		Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
cymbeline@9585	
cymbeline@9586	PISANIO	My lord your son drew on my master.
cymbeline@9630	
cymbeline@9631	QUEEN	Ha!
cymbeline@9641		No harm, I trust, is done?
cymbeline@9669	
cymbeline@9670	PISANIO	There might have been,
cymbeline@9701		But that my master rather play'd than fought
cymbeline@9747		And had no help of anger: they were parted
cymbeline@9791		By gentlemen at hand.
cymbeline@9814	
cymbeline@9815	QUEEN	I am very glad on't.
cymbeline@9842	
cymbeline@9843	IMOGEN	Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
cymbeline@9900		To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
cymbeline@9937		I would they were in Afric both together;
cymbeline@9980		Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
cymbeline@10025		The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
cymbeline@10072	
cymbeline@10073	PISANIO	On his command: he would not suffer me
cymbeline@10120		To bring him to the haven; left these notes
cymbeline@10165		Of what commands I should be subject to,
cymbeline@10207		When 't pleased you to employ me.
cymbeline@10242	
cymbeline@10243	QUEEN	This hath been
cymbeline@10264		Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
cymbeline@10311		He will remain so.
cymbeline@10331	
cymbeline@10332	PISANIO	                  I humbly thank your highness.
cymbeline@10388	
cymbeline@10389	QUEEN	Pray, walk awhile.
cymbeline@10414	
cymbeline@10415	IMOGEN	                  About some half-hour hence,
cymbeline@10468		I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
cymbeline@10515		Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.

cymbeline@10635	
cymbeline@10636	
cymbeline@10637		[Enter CLOTEN and two Lords]
cymbeline@10667	
cymbeline@10668	First Lord	Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
cymbeline@10725		violence of action hath made you reek as a
cymbeline@10769		sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
cymbeline@10816		there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
cymbeline@10868	
cymbeline@10869	CLOTEN	If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
cymbeline@10936	
cymbeline@10937	Second Lord	[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.
cymbeline@10999	
cymbeline@11000	First Lord	Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
cymbeline@11061		not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
cymbeline@11123	
cymbeline@11124	Second Lord	[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' the
cymbeline@11183		backside the town.
cymbeline@11203	
cymbeline@11204	CLOTEN	The villain would not stand me.
cymbeline@11243	
cymbeline@11244	Second Lord	[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
cymbeline@11314	
cymbeline@11315	First Lord	Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
cymbeline@11375		he added to your having; gave you some ground.
cymbeline@11423	
cymbeline@11424	Second Lord	[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
cymbeline@11489	
cymbeline@11490	CLOTEN	I would they had not come between us.
cymbeline@11535	
cymbeline@11536	Second Lord	[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long
cymbeline@11600		a fool you were upon the ground.
cymbeline@11634	
cymbeline@11635	CLOTEN	And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
cymbeline@11694	
cymbeline@11695	Second Lord	[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she
cymbeline@11760		is damned.
cymbeline@11772	
cymbeline@11773	First Lord	Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
cymbeline@11836		go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
cymbeline@11889		small reflection of her wit.
cymbeline@11919	
cymbeline@11920	Second Lord	[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the
cymbeline@11977		reflection should hurt her.
cymbeline@12006	
cymbeline@12007	CLOTEN	Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
cymbeline@12066		hurt done!
cymbeline@12078	
cymbeline@12079	Second Lord	[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
cymbeline@12143		of an ass, which is no great hurt.
cymbeline@12179	
cymbeline@12180	CLOTEN	You'll go with us?
cymbeline@12206	
cymbeline@12207	First Lord	I'll attend your lordship.
cymbeline@12245	
cymbeline@12246	CLOTEN	Nay, come, let's go together.
cymbeline@12283	
cymbeline@12284	Second Lord	Well, my lord.

cymbeline@12345	
cymbeline@12346

cymbeline@12348	SCENE III	A room in Cymbeline's palace.
cymbeline@12388	
cymbeline@12389	
cymbeline@12390		[Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO]
cymbeline@12418	
cymbeline@12419	IMOGEN	I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
cymbeline@12477		And question'dst every sail: if he should write
cymbeline@12526		And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
cymbeline@12565		As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
cymbeline@12605		That he spake to thee?
cymbeline@12629	
cymbeline@12630	PISANIO	It was his queen, his queen!
cymbeline@12667	
cymbeline@12668	IMOGEN	Then waved his handkerchief?
cymbeline@12704	
cymbeline@12705	PISANIO	And kiss'd it, madam.
cymbeline@12735	
cymbeline@12736	IMOGEN	Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
cymbeline@12784		And that was all?
cymbeline@12803	
cymbeline@12804	PISANIO	                  No, madam; for so long
cymbeline@12853		As he could make me with this eye or ear
cymbeline@12895		Distinguish him from others, he did keep
cymbeline@12937		The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
cymbeline@12985		Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind
cymbeline@13033		Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
cymbeline@13082		How swift his ship.
cymbeline@13103	
cymbeline@13104	IMOGEN	Thou shouldst have made him
cymbeline@13139		As little as a crow, or less, ere left
cymbeline@13179		To after-eye him.
cymbeline@13198	
cymbeline@13199	PISANIO	                  Madam, so I did.
cymbeline@13242	
cymbeline@13243	IMOGEN	I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
cymbeline@13305		To look upon him, till the diminution
cymbeline@13344		Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
cymbeline@13390		Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
cymbeline@13434		The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
cymbeline@13476		Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
cymbeline@13527		When shall we hear from him?
cymbeline@13557	
cymbeline@13558	PISANIO	Be assured, madam,
cymbeline@13585		With his next vantage.
cymbeline@13609	
cymbeline@13610	IMOGEN	I did not take my leave of him, but had
cymbeline@13657		Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
cymbeline@13706		How I would think on him at certain hours
cymbeline@13749		Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
cymbeline@13800		The shes of Italy should not betray
cymbeline@13837		Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
cymbeline@13889		At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
cymbeline@13939		To encounter me with orisons, for then
cymbeline@13979		I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
cymbeline@14019		Give him that parting kiss which I had set
cymbeline@14063		Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
cymbeline@14111		And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
cymbeline@14158		Shakes all our buds from growing.
cymbeline@14193	
cymbeline@14194		[Enter a Lady]
cymbeline@14210	
cymbeline@14211	Lady	The queen, madam,
cymbeline@14234		Desires your highness' company.
cymbeline@14267	
cymbeline@14268	IMOGEN	Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
cymbeline@14323		I will attend the queen.

cymbeline@14402	ACT I
cymbeline@14408	
cymbeline@14409	
cymbeline@14410	
cymbeline@14411	SCENE IV	Rome. Philario's house.
cymbeline@14444	
cymbeline@14445	
cymbeline@14446		[Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a
cymbeline@14488		Dutchman, and a Spaniard]
cymbeline@14515	
cymbeline@14516	IACHIMO	Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was
cymbeline@14576		then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy
cymbeline@14630		as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I
cymbeline@14680		could then have looked on him without the help of
cymbeline@14731		admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments
cymbeline@14783		had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
cymbeline@14842	
cymbeline@14843	PHILARIO	You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
cymbeline@14905		he is with that which makes him both without and within.
cymbeline@14963	
cymbeline@14964	Frenchman	I have seen him in France: we had very many there
cymbeline@15024		could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
cymbeline@15071	
cymbeline@15072	IACHIMO	This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein
cymbeline@15133		he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,
cymbeline@15187		words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
cymbeline@15242	
cymbeline@15243	Frenchman	And then his banishment.
cymbeline@15278	
cymbeline@15279	IACHIMO	Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this
cymbeline@15335		lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
cymbeline@15389		to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,
cymbeline@15440		which else an easy battery might lay flat, for
cymbeline@15488		taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
cymbeline@15541		it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
cymbeline@15583		acquaintance?
cymbeline@15598	
cymbeline@15599	PHILARIO	His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I
cymbeline@15659		have been often bound for no less than my life.
cymbeline@15708		Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
cymbeline@15758		amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
cymbeline@15804		knowing, to a stranger of his quality.
cymbeline@15844	
cymbeline@15845		[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS]
cymbeline@15873	
cymbeline@15874		I beseech you all, be better known to this
cymbeline@15918		gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
cymbeline@15970		of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
cymbeline@16020		hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.
cymbeline@16074	
cymbeline@16075	Frenchman	Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
cymbeline@16125	
cymbeline@16126	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
cymbeline@16198		which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
cymbeline@16246	
cymbeline@16247	Frenchman	Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I
cymbeline@16307		did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
cymbeline@16358		you should have been put together with so mortal a
cymbeline@16410		purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
cymbeline@16460		slight and trivial a nature.
cymbeline@16490	
cymbeline@16491	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;
cymbeline@16561		rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
cymbeline@16614		my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
cymbeline@16668		but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
cymbeline@16721		it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
cymbeline@16774	
cymbeline@16775	Frenchman	'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,
cymbeline@16838		and by such two that would by all likelihood have
cymbeline@16889		confounded one the other, or have fallen both.
cymbeline@16937	
cymbeline@16938	IACHIMO	Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
cymbeline@16997	
cymbeline@16998	Frenchman	Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,
cymbeline@17055		which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
cymbeline@17109		It was much like an argument that fell out last
cymbeline@17158		night, where each of us fell in praise of our
cymbeline@17205		country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
cymbeline@17254		vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
cymbeline@17292		affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
cymbeline@17343		chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
cymbeline@17392		than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
cymbeline@17438	
cymbeline@17439	IACHIMO	That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
cymbeline@17496		opinion by this worn out.
cymbeline@17523	
cymbeline@17524	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
cymbeline@17585	
cymbeline@17586	IACHIMO	You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
cymbeline@17646	
cymbeline@17647	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would
cymbeline@17716		abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
cymbeline@17764		adorer, not her friend.
cymbeline@17789	
cymbeline@17790	IACHIMO	As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
cymbeline@17842		comparison--had been something too fair and too good
cymbeline@17896		for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
cymbeline@17948		I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
cymbeline@17998		many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
cymbeline@18047		excelled many: but I have not seen the most
cymbeline@18092		precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.
cymbeline@18137	
cymbeline@18138	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
cymbeline@18205	
cymbeline@18206	IACHIMO	What do you esteem it at?
cymbeline@18240	
cymbeline@18241	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	More than the world enjoys.
cymbeline@18288	
cymbeline@18289	IACHIMO	Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's
cymbeline@18348		outprized by a trifle.
cymbeline@18372	
cymbeline@18373	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if
cymbeline@18444		there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
cymbeline@18497		for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
cymbeline@18547		and only the gift of the gods.
cymbeline@18579	
cymbeline@18580	IACHIMO	Which the gods have given you?
cymbeline@18619	
cymbeline@18620	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Which, by their graces, I will keep.
cymbeline@18676	
cymbeline@18677	IACHIMO	You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,
cymbeline@18733		strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
cymbeline@18783		ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
cymbeline@18836		estimations; the one is but frail and the other
cymbeline@18885		casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
cymbeline@18938		courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
cymbeline@18998	
cymbeline@18999	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
cymbeline@19070		to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
cymbeline@19121		holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
cymbeline@19172		nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
cymbeline@19214		notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
cymbeline@19252	
cymbeline@19253	PHILARIO	Let us leave here, gentlemen.
cymbeline@19292	
cymbeline@19293	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I
cymbeline@19359		thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
cymbeline@19422	
cymbeline@19423	IACHIMO	With five times so much conversation, I should get
cymbeline@19482		ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
cymbeline@19536		to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.
cymbeline@19598	
cymbeline@19599	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	No, no.
cymbeline@19626	
cymbeline@19627	IACHIMO	I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
cymbeline@19684		your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it
cymbeline@19732		something: but I make my wager rather against your
cymbeline@19784		confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
cymbeline@19834		offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
cymbeline@19886		lady in the world.
cymbeline@19906	
cymbeline@19907	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	You are a great deal abused in too bold a
cymbeline@19968		persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're
cymbeline@20021		worthy of by your attempt.
cymbeline@20049	
cymbeline@20050	IACHIMO	What's that?
cymbeline@20071	
cymbeline@20072	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,
cymbeline@20139		deserve more; a punishment too.
cymbeline@20172	
cymbeline@20173	PHILARIO	Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;
cymbeline@20234		let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
cymbeline@20282		better acquainted.
cymbeline@20302	
cymbeline@20303	IACHIMO	Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
cymbeline@20363		approbation of what I have spoke!
cymbeline@20398	
cymbeline@20399	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	What lady would you choose to assail?
cymbeline@20456	
cymbeline@20457	IACHIMO	Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
cymbeline@20516		I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
cymbeline@20566		that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
cymbeline@20617		with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
cymbeline@20667		second conference, and I will bring from thence
cymbeline@20716		that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
cymbeline@20768	
cymbeline@20769	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring
cymbeline@20839		I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
cymbeline@20883	
cymbeline@20884	IACHIMO	You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy
cymbeline@20942		ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
cymbeline@20989		preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
cymbeline@21041		religion in you, that you fear.
cymbeline@21074	
cymbeline@21075	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a
cymbeline@21142		graver purpose, I hope.
cymbeline@21167	
cymbeline@21168	IACHIMO	I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo
cymbeline@21226		what's spoken, I swear.
cymbeline@21251	
cymbeline@21252	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
cymbeline@21319		return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
cymbeline@21371		mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
cymbeline@21422		unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
cymbeline@21484	
cymbeline@21485	PHILARIO	I will have it no lay.
cymbeline@21517	
cymbeline@21518	IACHIMO	By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
cymbeline@21568		sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
cymbeline@21622		bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
cymbeline@21676		are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,
cymbeline@21727		and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
cymbeline@21779		she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
cymbeline@21829		yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
cymbeline@21883		free entertainment.
cymbeline@21904	
cymbeline@21905	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I embrace these conditions; let us have articles
cymbeline@21973		betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if
cymbeline@22022		you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
cymbeline@22074		to understand you have prevailed, I am no further
cymbeline@22125		your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she
cymbeline@22174		remain unseduced, you not making it appear
cymbeline@22218		otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you
cymbeline@22271		have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
cymbeline@22323		your sword.
cymbeline@22336	
cymbeline@22337	IACHIMO	Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set
cymbeline@22398		down by lawful counsel, and straight away for
cymbeline@22445		Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and
cymbeline@22494		starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two
cymbeline@22541		wagers recorded.
cymbeline@22559	
cymbeline@22560	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Agreed.
cymbeline@22587	
cymbeline@22588		[Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO]
cymbeline@22629	
cymbeline@22630	Frenchman	Will this hold, think you?
cymbeline@22667	
cymbeline@22668	PHILARIO	Signior Iachimo will not from it.
cymbeline@22711		Pray, let us follow 'em.

cymbeline@22774	SCENE V	Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
cymbeline@22821	
cymbeline@22822	
cymbeline@22823		[Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS]
cymbeline@22861	
cymbeline@22862	QUEEN	Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
cymbeline@22922		Make haste: who has the note of them?
cymbeline@22961	
cymbeline@22962	First Lady	I, madam.
cymbeline@22983	
cymbeline@22984	QUEEN	Dispatch.
cymbeline@23000	
cymbeline@23001		[Exeunt Ladies]
cymbeline@23018	
cymbeline@23019		Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?
cymbeline@23070	
cymbeline@23071	CORNELIUS	Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:
cymbeline@23131	
cymbeline@23132		[Presenting a small box]
cymbeline@23158	
cymbeline@23159		But I beseech your grace, without offence,--
cymbeline@23205		My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
cymbeline@23252		Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,
cymbeline@23301		Which are the movers of a languishing death;
cymbeline@23347		But though slow, deadly?
cymbeline@23373	
cymbeline@23374	QUEEN	I wonder, doctor,
cymbeline@23398		Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
cymbeline@23447		Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
cymbeline@23493		To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
cymbeline@23538		That our great king himself doth woo me oft
cymbeline@23583		For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--
cymbeline@23633		Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
cymbeline@23682		That I did amplify my judgment in
cymbeline@23717		Other conclusions? I will try the forces
cymbeline@23759		Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
cymbeline@23804		We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
cymbeline@23853		To try the vigour of them and apply
cymbeline@23890		Allayments to their act, and by them gather
cymbeline@23935		Their several virtues and effects.
cymbeline@23971	
cymbeline@23972	CORNELIUS	Your highness
cymbeline@23996		Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:
cymbeline@24048		Besides, the seeing these effects will be
cymbeline@24091		Both noisome and infectious.
cymbeline@24121	
cymbeline@24122	QUEEN	O, content thee.
cymbeline@24145	
cymbeline@24146		[Enter PISANIO]
cymbeline@24163	
cymbeline@24164		[Aside]
cymbeline@24173	
cymbeline@24174		Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
cymbeline@24216		Will I first work: he's for his master,
cymbeline@24257		An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!
cymbeline@24296		Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
cymbeline@24342		Take your own way.
cymbeline@24362	
cymbeline@24363	CORNELIUS	[Aside]          I do suspect you, madam;
cymbeline@24415		But you shall do no harm.
cymbeline@24442	
cymbeline@24443	QUEEN	[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word.
cymbeline@24492	
cymbeline@24493	CORNELIUS	[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has
cymbeline@24554		Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,
cymbeline@24604		And will not trust one of her malice with
cymbeline@24647		A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
cymbeline@24692		Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
cymbeline@24733		Which first, perchance, she'll prove on
cymbeline@24774		cats and dogs,
cymbeline@24790		Then afterward up higher: but there is
cymbeline@24830		No danger in what show of death it makes,
cymbeline@24873		More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
cymbeline@24919		To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
cymbeline@24962		With a most false effect; and I the truer,
cymbeline@25006		So to be false with her.
cymbeline@25032	
cymbeline@25033	QUEEN	No further service, doctor,
cymbeline@25067		Until I send for thee.
cymbeline@25091	
cymbeline@25092	CORNELIUS	I humbly take my leave.
cymbeline@25126	
cymbeline@25127		[Exit]
cymbeline@25135	
cymbeline@25136	QUEEN	Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
cymbeline@25196		She will not quench and let instructions enter
cymbeline@25244		Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
cymbeline@25286		When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
cymbeline@25335		I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
cymbeline@25380		As great as is thy master, greater, for
cymbeline@25421		His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
cymbeline@25467		Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
cymbeline@25507		Continue where he is: to shift his being
cymbeline@25549		Is to exchange one misery with another,
cymbeline@25590		And every day that comes comes to decay
cymbeline@25631		A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
cymbeline@25677		To be depender on a thing that leans,
cymbeline@25716		Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
cymbeline@25762		So much as but to prop him?
cymbeline@25791	
cymbeline@25792		[The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up]
cymbeline@25840	
cymbeline@25841			      Thou takest up
cymbeline@25864		Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:
cymbeline@25916		It is a thing I made, which hath the king
cymbeline@25959		Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know
cymbeline@26006		What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;
cymbeline@26054		It is an earnest of a further good
cymbeline@26090		That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
cymbeline@26134		The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
cymbeline@26183		Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
cymbeline@26232		Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
cymbeline@26280		Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
cymbeline@26331		To any shape of thy preferment such
cymbeline@26368		As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
cymbeline@26416		That set thee on to this desert, am bound
cymbeline@26459		To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
cymbeline@26501		Think on my words.
cymbeline@26521	
cymbeline@26522		[Exit PISANIO]
cymbeline@26538	
cymbeline@26539			A sly and constant knave,
cymbeline@26567		Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
cymbeline@26611		And the remembrancer of her to hold
cymbeline@26648		The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
cymbeline@26698		Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
cymbeline@26743		Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
cymbeline@26791		Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
cymbeline@26837		To taste of too.
cymbeline@26855	
cymbeline@26856		[Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies]
cymbeline@26887	
cymbeline@26888		So, so: well done, well done:
cymbeline@26919		The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
cymbeline@26962		Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
cymbeline@27007		Think on my words.
cymbeline@27027	
cymbeline@27028		[Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies]
cymbeline@27055	
cymbeline@27056	PISANIO	And shall do:
cymbeline@27078		But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
cymbeline@27120		I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.

cymbeline@27195	ACT I
cymbeline@27201	
cymbeline@27202	
cymbeline@27203	
cymbeline@27204	SCENE VI	The same. Another room in the palace.
cymbeline@27251	
cymbeline@27252	
cymbeline@27253		[Enter IMOGEN]
cymbeline@27269	
cymbeline@27270	IMOGEN	A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
cymbeline@27316		A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
cymbeline@27352		That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!
cymbeline@27403		My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
cymbeline@27450		Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
cymbeline@27493		As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
cymbeline@27540		Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
cymbeline@27588		How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
cymbeline@27636		Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
cymbeline@27682	
cymbeline@27683		[Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO]
cymbeline@27712	
cymbeline@27713	PISANIO	Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
cymbeline@27755		Comes from my lord with letters.
cymbeline@27789	
cymbeline@27790	IACHIMO	Change you, madam?
cymbeline@27817		The worthy Leonatus is in safety
cymbeline@27851		And greets your highness dearly.
cymbeline@27885	
cymbeline@27886		[Presents a letter]
cymbeline@27907	
cymbeline@27908	IMOGEN	Thanks, good sir:
cymbeline@27933		You're kindly welcome.
cymbeline@27957	
cymbeline@27958	IACHIMO	[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!
cymbeline@28017		If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
cymbeline@28059		She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
cymbeline@28097		Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
cymbeline@28142		Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
cymbeline@28180		Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
cymbeline@28226		Rather directly fly.
cymbeline@28248	
cymbeline@28249	IMOGEN	[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
cymbeline@28306		kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
cymbeline@28358		him accordingly, as you value your trust--
cymbeline@28402				 LEONATUS.'
cymbeline@28417		So far I read aloud:
cymbeline@28439		But even the very middle of my heart
cymbeline@28477		Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
cymbeline@28526		You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
cymbeline@28564		Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
cymbeline@28609		In all that I can do.
cymbeline@28632	
cymbeline@28633	IACHIMO	Thanks, fairest lady.
cymbeline@28663		What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
cymbeline@28711		To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
cymbeline@28756		Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
cymbeline@28803		The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
cymbeline@28848		Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
cymbeline@28889		Partition make with spectacles so precious
cymbeline@28933		'Twixt fair and foul?
cymbeline@28956	
cymbeline@28957	IMOGEN	What makes your admiration?
cymbeline@28992	
cymbeline@28993	IACHIMO	It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
cymbeline@29047		'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
cymbeline@29096		Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,
cymbeline@29147		For idiots in this case of favour would
cymbeline@29188		Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
cymbeline@29230		Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
cymbeline@29272		Should make desire vomit emptiness,
cymbeline@29309		Not so allured to feed.
cymbeline@29334	
cymbeline@29335	IMOGEN	What is the matter, trow?
cymbeline@29368	
cymbeline@29369	IACHIMO	The cloyed will,
cymbeline@29394		That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
cymbeline@29441		Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb
cymbeline@29491		Longs after for the garbage.
cymbeline@29521	
cymbeline@29522	IMOGEN	What, dear sir,
cymbeline@29545		Thus raps you? Are you well?
cymbeline@29575	
cymbeline@29576	IACHIMO	Thanks, madam; well.
cymbeline@29605	
cymbeline@29606		[To PISANIO]
cymbeline@29620	
cymbeline@29621			 Beseech you, sir, desire
cymbeline@29649		My man's abode where I did leave him: he
cymbeline@29691		Is strange and peevish.
cymbeline@29716	
cymbeline@29717	PISANIO	I was going, sir,
cymbeline@29743		To give him welcome.
cymbeline@29765	
cymbeline@29766		[Exit]
cymbeline@29774	
cymbeline@29775	IMOGEN	Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?
cymbeline@29831	
cymbeline@29832	IACHIMO	Well, madam.
cymbeline@29853	
cymbeline@29854	IMOGEN	Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
cymbeline@29900	
cymbeline@29901	IACHIMO	Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
cymbeline@29951		So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
cymbeline@29991		The Briton reveller.
cymbeline@30013	
cymbeline@30014	IMOGEN	When he was here,
cymbeline@30039		He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
cymbeline@30081		Not knowing why.
cymbeline@30099	
cymbeline@30100	IACHIMO	                  I never saw him sad.
cymbeline@30147		There is a Frenchman his companion, one
cymbeline@30188		An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
cymbeline@30237		A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
cymbeline@30274		The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
cymbeline@30327		Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
cymbeline@30383		Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
cymbeline@30432		By history, report, or his own proof,
cymbeline@30471		What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
cymbeline@30515		But must be, will his free hours languish for
cymbeline@30562		Assured bondage?'
cymbeline@30581	
cymbeline@30582	IMOGEN	                  Will my lord say so?
cymbeline@30628	
cymbeline@30629	IACHIMO	Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:
cymbeline@30686		It is a recreation to be by
cymbeline@30715		And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
cymbeline@30768		Some men are much to blame.
cymbeline@30797	
cymbeline@30798	IMOGEN	Not he, I hope.
cymbeline@30821	
cymbeline@30822	IACHIMO	Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
cymbeline@30880		Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
cymbeline@30929		In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
cymbeline@30978		Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
cymbeline@31019		To pity too.
cymbeline@31033	
cymbeline@31034	IMOGEN	                  What do you pity, sir?
cymbeline@31082	
cymbeline@31083	IACHIMO	Two creatures heartily.
cymbeline@31115	
cymbeline@31116	IMOGEN	Am I one, sir?
cymbeline@31138		You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
cymbeline@31184		Deserves your pity?
cymbeline@31205	
cymbeline@31206	IACHIMO	Lamentable! What,
cymbeline@31232		To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
cymbeline@31276		I' the dungeon by a snuff?
cymbeline@31304	
cymbeline@31305	IMOGEN	I pray you, sir,
cymbeline@31329		Deliver with more openness your answers
cymbeline@31370		To my demands. Why do you pity me?
cymbeline@31406	
cymbeline@31407	IACHIMO	That others do--
cymbeline@31432		I was about to say--enjoy your--But
cymbeline@31469		It is an office of the gods to venge it,
cymbeline@31511		Not mine to speak on 't.
cymbeline@31537	
cymbeline@31538	IMOGEN	You do seem to know
cymbeline@31565		Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
cymbeline@31616		Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
cymbeline@31663		Than to be sure they do; for certainties
cymbeline@31705		Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
cymbeline@31752		The remedy then born--discover to me
cymbeline@31790		What both you spur and stop.
cymbeline@31820	
cymbeline@31821	IACHIMO	Had I this cheek
cymbeline@31846		To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
cymbeline@31894		Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
cymbeline@31944		To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
cymbeline@31988		Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
cymbeline@32033		Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
cymbeline@32078		Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
cymbeline@32120		That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
cymbeline@32168		Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
cymbeline@32216		With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
cymbeline@32256		Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
cymbeline@32296		That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
cymbeline@32342		That all the plagues of hell should at one time
cymbeline@32391		Encounter such revolt.
cymbeline@32415	
cymbeline@32416	IMOGEN	My lord, I fear,
cymbeline@32440		Has forgot Britain.
cymbeline@32461	
cymbeline@32462	IACHIMO	And himself. Not I,
cymbeline@32490		Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
cymbeline@32532		The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
cymbeline@32581		That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
cymbeline@32627		Charms this report out.
cymbeline@32652	
cymbeline@32653	IMOGEN	Let me hear no more.
cymbeline@32681	
cymbeline@32682	IACHIMO	O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
cymbeline@32738		With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
cymbeline@32781		So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
cymbeline@32818		Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd
cymbeline@32873		With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
cymbeline@32919		Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
cymbeline@32973		That play with all infirmities for gold
cymbeline@33014		Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
cymbeline@33067		As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
cymbeline@33110		Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
cymbeline@33154		Recoil from your great stock.
cymbeline@33185	
cymbeline@33186	IMOGEN	Revenged!
cymbeline@33203		How should I be revenged? If this be true,--
cymbeline@33249		As I have such a heart that both mine ears
cymbeline@33293		Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
cymbeline@33334		How should I be revenged?
cymbeline@33361	
cymbeline@33362	IACHIMO	Should he make me
cymbeline@33388		Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
cymbeline@33437		Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
cymbeline@33476		In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
cymbeline@33523		I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
cymbeline@33566		More noble than that runagate to your bed,
cymbeline@33610		And will continue fast to your affection,
cymbeline@33653		Still close as sure.
cymbeline@33675	
cymbeline@33676	IMOGEN	What, ho, Pisanio!
cymbeline@33702	
cymbeline@33703	IACHIMO	Let me my service tender on your lips.
cymbeline@33750	
cymbeline@33751	IMOGEN	Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
cymbeline@33797		So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
cymbeline@33846		Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
cymbeline@33896		For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
cymbeline@33948		Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
cymbeline@33990		From thy report as thou from honour, and
cymbeline@34032		Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
cymbeline@34070		Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
cymbeline@34115		The king my father shall be made acquainted
cymbeline@34160		Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
cymbeline@34203		A saucy stranger in his court to mart
cymbeline@34242		As in a Romish stew and to expound
cymbeline@34278		His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
cymbeline@34319		He little cares for and a daughter who
cymbeline@34359		He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!
cymbeline@34403	
cymbeline@34404	IACHIMO	O happy Leonatus! I may say
cymbeline@34440		The credit that thy lady hath of thee
cymbeline@34479		Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
cymbeline@34530		Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
cymbeline@34574		A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
cymbeline@34613		Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
cymbeline@34661		For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
cymbeline@34711		I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
cymbeline@34756		Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,
cymbeline@34803		That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
cymbeline@34846		The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
cymbeline@34886		That he enchants societies into him;
cymbeline@34924		Half all men's hearts are his.
cymbeline@34956	
cymbeline@34957	IMOGEN	You make amends.
cymbeline@34981	
cymbeline@34982	IACHIMO	He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
cymbeline@35032		He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
cymbeline@35072		More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
cymbeline@35115		Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
cymbeline@35161		To try your taking a false report; which hath
cymbeline@35208		Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
cymbeline@35256		In the election of a sir so rare,
cymbeline@35291		Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
cymbeline@35339		Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
cymbeline@35388		Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
cymbeline@35438	
cymbeline@35439	IMOGEN	All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
cymbeline@35490		for yours.
cymbeline@35502	
cymbeline@35503	IACHIMO	My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
cymbeline@35549		To entreat your grace but in a small request,
cymbeline@35596		And yet of moment to, for it concerns
cymbeline@35635		Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
cymbeline@35679		Are partners in the business.
cymbeline@35710	
cymbeline@35711	IMOGEN	Pray, what is't?
cymbeline@35735	
cymbeline@35736	IACHIMO	Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
cymbeline@35784		The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
cymbeline@35833		To buy a present for the emperor
cymbeline@35867		Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
cymbeline@35912		In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
cymbeline@35962		Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
cymbeline@36011		And I am something
